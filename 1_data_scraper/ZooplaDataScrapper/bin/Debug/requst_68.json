Premier Islington position??? Grade II listed property??? Barnsbury conservation area??? Semi-detached with garage to side??? Private shingle carriage driveway??? 6 bedrooms, 4 Receptions, 3 bathrooms??? over 3,500 sq ft.??? Delightful mature gardens.This impressive semi-detached Grade II listed house is set in arguably the most sought after location in Islington. This private crescent traces its history back to a former Reed moat Field and Pond Field. Mr Whowell Esquire then paid plans for a leasehold estate which became the Mountfort Estate, whilst the villas were built circa 1845 and now within the Barnsbury conservation area. This attractive semi-detached villa enjoys a generous plot and wonderful aspect with over 3,500 sq. Ft. Of internal space. The house offers flexible living, currently laid out as six bedrooms and three bathrooms to the first and second floors. The ground floor is entered via a spacious hallway of grand proportions. The inner central hallway leads to a delightful reception room to the front with a tall sash bay window, ornate coving and great views of the external carriage drive. To the rear is a light and spacious dining room and conservatory with direct access to the wonderful garden. A further breakfast room and kitchen are also set to the rear. A cloakroom and back door leads to the garage which is built to the side of the house. The generous garden is arranged with well stocked mature borders, central pond and patio area and extending lawn area all enjoying a westerly aspect.   The basement provides plenty of good storage space and scope, subject to planning and building consents. Islington Green, Angel and Highbury & Islington stations are close by, whilst King's Cross and St Pancras stations are within 1.3 miles. Islington has a sophisticated and wide range of shops, restaurants, and bars. Local and internationally acclaimed theatres such as Sadler's Wells, the Almeida, King's Head and Little Angel all add to the cultural wealth of the area. The financial and legal centre of London is a 10 minute taxi ride away, whilst the Cross Rail II proposal will add further strength to the good transport links.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43365922?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"This impressive semi-detached Grade II listed house is set in arguably the most sought after location in Islington.
