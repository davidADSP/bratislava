With over 100,000 people working in Canary Wharf at offices including those of hsbc, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, kpmg and Morgan Stanley.Popular with city professionals working in the area, Canary Wharf provides an easy commute and plenty of opportunities for after work activities. The area is also popular with students and families, and provides exciting opportunities for investors and first-time buyers. The area has a mix of rental and owner occupied properties.Fantastic Transport LinksLocated on the West India Docks on the Isle of Dogs, Canary Wharf is very well connected, with the Jubilee Line allowing quick and easy access into central London, while the DLR serves the whole of the Isle of Dogs and area surrounding Canary Wharf, including Stratford and London City airport within 20 minutes. There are many options for buses into the city, and you can even travel by boat with regular services from Canary Wharf Pier to locations including London Bridge, Chelsea, Embankment, and nearby Greenwich. The future Crossrail development, set to open in 2018, will make journeys into the city even easier and faster.Crossrail will bring an extra 1.5 million people to within 45 minutes of central London and the Canary Wharf Station opens in 2018 bringing a further 115,000 sq ft of additional retail spaceThe WardianIn the midst of the skyscrapers and waterways of Canary Wharf, Wardian London offers an oasis of nature. Comprising two iconic apartment towers with restaurants, curated shops and stunning facilities, the vision is to create a new address like no other, a haven of peace and beauty in the heart of London.This theme isn't limited to the public spaces, but carries through into the apartments themselves, with every single apartment enjoying not just a balcony but a fully-fledged garden.Why Wardian? Because the towers design has been inspired by the work of one Londoner, the great explorer, botanist, and inventor, Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward. A doctor by trade, he changed the world with his botanical glass container, the deceptively simple-looking Wardian case, and while contemporary renderings of that design are a defining feature of Wardian, the influence goes beyond the mere visible. The vision for Wardian is to take inspiration from his curiosity, his spirit of adventure and his sense of precision, and to create the most exciting new development in the English capital.These particulars are not intended to, and do not offer or form part of any contract and whilst these sales particulars are believed to be correct, their accuracy is in no way guaranteed.
