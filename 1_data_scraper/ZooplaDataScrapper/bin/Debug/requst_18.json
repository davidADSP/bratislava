Thoughtfully refurbished by the current owners, who have a great eye, it is a perfect example of how brilliant ex-local authority flats can be.A hop, skip and jump from Highbury Fields, and only a short walk from the abundance of restaurants and shops of Upper Street, this wonderful home is ideally located for all the brilliant things going on in this much-coveted pocket of North London.Brickworks SaysWe love this small ???old school??? block, with only eleven flats in total, including the resident's office conveniently beneath on the ground floor. It is light, quiet, warm and built to last. The flat has great proportions too - the large bathroom is a boon, and the kitchen-come-reception is a fab space for entertaining.It is the tranquillity and brightness that we love most though. With three windows running the length of the living space, for example, this gorgeous room is flooded with natural light.The Owners SayOne of the first things you notice when you step into our home is just how quiet it is. Living only one minute from Highbury Barn, yet set well away from the road, it is amazing to come home to such a peaceful place.Having lived here for nearly five years, we???ve grown to love the Highbury Barn High Street (La Fromagerie and Da Mario in particular), and the open green space of Highbury Fields. The Fields is a great place to hang out throughout all the seasons, especially in the summer when everyone barbeques (one of the few parks in London to allow this), plus there are an impressive eleven tennis courts to choose from!On top of all this, it???s something we often take for granted, but Highbury is one of the best-connected places to live in North London.Points To ConsiderPart of the London Borough of Islington, the property falls within Council Tax Band C (??1,134 for 2016/17).There are 95 years (approx) left on the current lease, with Islington Council being the freeholder.Service charge is just shy of ??65 pcm and the ground rent is peppercorn at just ??10 a year.Matthews Court houses the Tenants???

The accommodation comprises a double-sized multifunctional reception room with spiral staircase to the first floor, and a bathroom with white suite including a corner bath. In my opinion, the real heart of this home lies to the rear of the ground floor; the stunning kitchen/breakfast room is the perfect space for any family gathering, boasting beautfiul views of the garden through the bi-fold doors and is flooded with natural light. To the first floor, there are three good-sized bedrooms and a modern shower room.The rear garden extends to just over 40 foot, and boasts a shed and raised patio area. The vendor informs us that it is a real suntrap in the summer months.1.
