The property has been finished to the highest specification throughout and is in our opinion one of the very best houses in the Moore Park Estate. This impressive family house is arranged over five floors and extends to just over 3,000 sq ft (279 sq m). The ground floor has been completely remodelled from the entrance hall into a spacious formal reception room with parquet flooring, and a contemporary kitchen with Miele & Gaggenau appliances with frameless sliding doors leading out onto a 23 private rear garden. The property has had a full basement excavation with high ceilings, oak flooring and plenty of natural light, comprising a double bedroom and en-suite shower room, utility room, bar area and a large family room to the rear with sliding doors also providing access to the garden. The entire first floor is dedicated to a luxurious master bedroom suite complete with a large bathroom with a bath and separate shower as well as a dressing room with access onto a roof terrace. The two floors above offer a further three double bedrooms and two further bathrooms, one of which is en-suite. The house has been completed with premium finishes including Cat 6 cabling throughout, zoned speaker system, waterbased underfloor heating system throughout the basement and ground floor, a Banham alarm and CCTV system.Rumbold Road is arguably the prettiest and most desirable of the collection of roads that make up the coveted Moore Park Estate, located only a stones throw from Chelsea.

A beautifully appointed narrowboat awaits for an individual or couple with lots of natural light and feeling of space on board. The cabin to the aft of the boat has a full sized doubled bed and plenty of storage space. The galley is also well equipped with gas cooker and leads into the large living area with multifuel stove. The boat was recently surveyed, dry-docked and the hull bitumen-blacked over Easter 2016. Before that, Easter 2014. Next scheduled blacking is c2019. Boat safety certificate: 2012, renewal 2017, but new certificate will be issued before boat is handed over. There really is nothing to be done on this boat and it is ready to be moved straight onto. Beneath the hatches is a bmc 1.8 Litre 4-Cylinder water cooled diesel marine-modified engine, developing 40HP. This engine, a popular choice for many narrowboats, is robust with no electronics to break down. The engine supplies the living accommodation hot water tank via a calorifier. Also in the engine bay are two large marine leisure batteries and a separate engine battery. A large diesel tank for the engine is located at the furthest point astern. The engine was removed, fully reconditioned and reseated in 2012. In April 2016, a new exhaust and alternator was fitted, and the stern gland repacked by a marine engineer. The Three Mills residential mooring is one of the least expensive permanent moorings in London. Current mooring fees are around ??440 per month, but buyers must negotiate direct with the landlord on purchasing the boat. On one side of the mooring is a wooded park, accessed via locked gates, through the 3 Mills conservation area and film studios. Walk over the canal bridge to Bromley-by-Bow tube station on the District/Hammersmith & City lines, within 10 minutes walk of the boat. The other side is a development of housing, shops and restaurants, at present under construction. The mooring is very secure, with manned barriers into a free car park, a free laundry, sheds & coal store accessed by code-pad.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43352301?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Peach Properties in partnership with Boatshed London are delighted to offer this 1997 Pat Buckle 52ft all-steel narrowboat for sale with residential mooring at Three Mills Moorings in East London.
