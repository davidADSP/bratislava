The Granada opened in 1930, and after a long campaign by local residents it has recently reopened as a bar and live music venue. Now called Mirth, Marvel and Maud, this building is simply stunning. The hustle and bustle of the High Street is contrasted by the quiet residential streets that surround it. This part of Walthamstow really gives you the best of both worlds, a shopping hub, nightlife, and peace and quiet at home.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Dimensions:</strong></h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Entrance</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Via front door leading into:</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Entrance Hallway</strong> (6.68m x 1.83m (21'11 x 6'0))</h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Reception Room</strong> (3.38m x 3.18m (11'1 x 10'5))</h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Kitchen</strong> (2.59m x 2.39m (8'6 x 7'10))</h3><p class=\"top\">Access To Rear Garden.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Bedroom One</strong> (3.53m x 3.48m (11'7 x 11'5))</h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Bedroom Two</strong> (3.38m x 3.20m (11'1 x 10'6))</h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Bathroom</strong> (2.59m x 2.46m (8'6 x 8'1))</h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Rear Garden (Shared South-Facing)</strong> (approx 9.14m (approx 30'))</h3><p class=\"top\">The information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of any offer or contract, nor may it be relied upon as representations or statements of fact.
