In short, you will not want to miss out on this rare opportunity ??? especially seeing as the property comes with the advantage of having no onward chain & a garage en-bloc!What the Owner says:When we first viewed this property ??? it was everything I was hoping for and more. I was struggling to find a flat that met my needs, and I loved the fact that being split level meant that I felt as if I had my own little house.The location has been second to none. Being so central to town has meant that commuting has been simple for my partner and me. The area is fantastic & so is the schooling.
