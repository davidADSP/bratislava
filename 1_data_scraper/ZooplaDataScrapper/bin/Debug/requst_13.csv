This sale represents a truly rare opportunity to buy one of these landmark houses that boasts incredible lateral space, width of plot and an alternative to the more common Victorian/ Edwardian architecture. The current owners have gone to great lengths to retain many of the original features, which will appeal to anyone with an interest in design and architecture.One of the most striking features as you enter the property, is the shear width of plot that measures in excess of 44ft across. To put this into context, the plot could easily accommodate two fairly significant Victorian houses, side by side.The sense of space is evident as soon as you walk through the front door to the stunning entrance hall, with its original panelling and open tread staircase. No less than four reception rooms lead from the entrance hall, one of which is open plan to the kitchen. There is direct access from two of the ground floor rooms to a superb south facing garden that measures in excess of 100 feet in length.Another feature that gives this house unique status is its pair of garages, that are situated at the end of the garden and accessed via Burntwood Grange. The opportunities for these garages are endless, from their original purpose as secure parking through to conversion to an annex, studio or playroom (subject to the usual consents).A spacious master bedroom can be found to the rear of the first floor with a luxurious en-suite bathroom and south facing balcony. Three further bedrooms and a family bathroom can also be found on the same level. The second-floor boasts two further good bedrooms, a shower room and a roof terrace.

The property also has off-street parking to the front, a landscaped front garden and side access.Herondale Avenue runs from Lyford Road to Ellerton Road. Wandsworth Common is at the eastern end of the road, so the amenities of Bellevue Road are within easy walking distance.

You may be experiencing major problems in finding that there is just nothing on the market that meets your high standards. Now this is where we are going to make your day, nestled in a coveted residential location you will find this spacious house, sitting pride of place in a convenient road.Inside, the property has kept a lot of the original features and offers excellent proportions with wonderful features such as the bay window and a log burner, creating an ideal place to snuggle up with a good book in the colder months. A separate dining area waits for you towards the back of the property - excellent for when you entertain at one of your dinner parties!Furthermore, this house is certainly an excellent size for the period of build with fantastic space, like the well-proportioned kitchen area and a further room which is currently used as a playroom.On the first floor this house doesn't let you down with spacious dimensions throughout all the bedrooms and the bathroom being a modern space you will love relaxing in at the end of the day.So you have looked at other four bedroom houses but what are they missing? Somewhere to park! So what you have here is a driveway to leave the car on and walk into town. To top everything off the property is superbly located with schools, great amenities and a train station all only a short walk away.What the Owner says:We bought this house 13 years ago as we completely fell in love with the size of it. The minute we walked through the door, we were bowled over by the large rooms and high ceilings. It was and is an excellent location for schools and having 2 boys, this was important to us. They both went to the Avenue which is an incredibly sought after school. The location is also ideal for the town centre and the station is very easy for commuting especially as we have a driveway so can leave the car at home. Since living here, we have replaced the central heating system and had the windows replaced. We also re-decorated throughout. It's an amazing home for any family and I will certainly miss the convenience of living here.Room sizes:Entrance HallLounge 14'3 x 12'9 (4.35m x 3.89m)Dining Area 11'5 x 10'7 (3.48m x 3.23m)Kitchen Area 8'8 x 8'7 (2.64m x 2.62m)Play room 18'0 x 11'10 (5.49m x 3.61m)LandingBathroom 8'11 x 8'0 (2.72m x 2.44m)Bedroom 1 14'3 x 12'0 (4.35m x 3.66m)Bedroom 3 10'7 x 10'0 (3.23m x 3.05m)Bedroom 2 15'7 x 11'6 (4.75m x 3.51m)Bedroom 4 8'1 x 6'5 (2.47m x 1.96m)Separate ToiletDrivewayRear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.
