If you enjoy entertaining then you will simply love the size of the kitchen/diner. A huge space which is just perfect for get-togethers and socialising.If cosy evenings in front of the television are more your thing then the lounge will be right up your street. An equally brilliant size and with a gas log burner to keep you warm in the colder months. If you need somewhere to work from home, the study is ideal but it could also be the 5th bedroom. One of the downstairs bedrooms is currently set out as a formal dining room but has the flexibility to be used for either. You could even use it as a play room/family room for the kids. There is a further double bedroom and beautiful bathroom on this level giving you somewhere stylish to escape to for a well earned soak. If you like large bedrooms you will be bowled over by the sheer size of both upstairs bedrooms and there is an additional shower room too - making the layout of this home just ideal for family life. The large rear garden has everything you could ask for. A choice of patios for a barbecue and plenty of space for the kids to tire themselves out playing. When the sun gets too hot just let down the awning and enjoy some shade. With a large garage /workshop and a in and out driveway that allows for lots of parking, this immaculate tardis really does have it all.What the Owner says:We have lived here for over 25 years and that in itself says it all. We have loved every minute of it! It's a great location as it has all the benefits of the town centre, stations and schools within reach yet so much peace and quiet at the same time. The size of the garden was also a huge factor as we love gardening and are big fans of growing our own! Over the years we have extended and have completely transformed the house with everything having been carefully designed to make the most of every space. It's a brilliant party house as well as a wonderful family home. The flexible layout makes it ideal for everyone - even accommodating older relatives too. We will miss it dearly but know it's now time for a new family to relish the benefits of living somewhere like this.Room sizes:Entrance HallKitchen/Diner 24'5 x 10'10 (7.45m x 3.30m)Lounge (l-shaped) 22'5 x 10'8 (6.84m x 3.25m) plus 6'7 x 6'6 (2.01m x 1.98m)Dining Room/Bedroom 3 13'5 x 11'3 (4.09m x 3.43m)Bedroom 4 13'2 x 11'1 (4.02m x 3.38m)Study/Bedroom 5 11'1 x 8'5 (3.38m x 2.57m)BathroomLandingBedroom 1 19'8 x 13'8 (6.00m x 4.17m)Bedroom 2 17'0 x 12'2 (5.19m x 3.71m)Shower RoomFront GardenDrivewayGarage/Workshop 30'2 x 10'4 (9.20m x 3.15m)Large Rear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

Not only is the property a rare find, but it is also being sold with the freehold for the building.In this description, we will cover some information about the property, the local schools, transport links and recreational facilities, however for those buyers that may not know Forest Hill so well we would encourage you to do some research on the location as it???s become one of South East London???s gems.In a time when much of large houses have historically been converted into many small apartments, it???s an absolute pleasure to find a building of this size separated in to only two properties and retains some stunning period features.This period style maisonette on Mayow Road offers some of the following period features to name a few:Large period style windows with stain glass featurePanelled doors stripped back to the woodA cast iron fire place with inset period tiles and granite style hearthA variation of cornicing and coving stylesPicture rails and ornate ceiling rosePeriod style window shutters and sash windowsStripped and varnished floor boardsPeriod style skirting boards and door architravesThe front garden faces easterly capturing the morning light whilst the rear garden faces westerly capturing the afternoon sun with the front garden offering gated parking for multiple cars allocated to this maisonette.The private rear garden is almost 80 feet in length and 35 feet wide. There is a raised, decked patio area and a garden shed offering approximately 128 sq ft of storage space which could be converted to a studio, workshop or other out building subject to consents.At over 2550 sq ft of internal space, the maisonette offers the same space as approximately two, three bedroom houses combined making it an extremely generous sized property which would rival many four and five bedroom houses locally.Although the property is being marketed as a four bedroom it can also be utilised as a three bedroom with two reception rooms and you will note from the images that the current owner is currently using one of the rooms as a dedicated dining area which is great for entertaining.Located on a wide tree lined road only approximately 0.7 miles to Forest Hill station and Sydenham station in the opposite direction, the property is well located for amenities and transport links.Forest Hill features several small independent high street conveniences including an award-winning butcher, some fantastic cafes, several boutique shops selling clothing and furniture as well as a few great modern, gastro and family friendly pubs.The Sylvan Post, Canvas and Cream and Stag and Bow all variously host, music events, exhibitions and craft days.However, if you require the convenience of a large well known supermarket and other known high street names, you will find Sainsbury???s, Boots and wh Smith along the high street too.Schools are A big attraction in forest hill:Church Rise is in proximity of several local schools which are in Ofsted's top 10%. In our experience, it???s unusual to find a house that is located to this many highly-rated schools. Four of those schools are as follows however there are other well-known local schools including an independent Montessori just a few minutes away:St Dunstan's College - Church of England, mixed, primary and secondary. This is a private school.Fairlawn - Public, mixed, primary, rated Ofsted \"Outstanding\".Kilmorie - Public, mixed, primary, rated Ofsted \"Good\".Dalmain - Public, mixed, primary, rated Ofsted \"Good\".TransportApproximately 0.7 miles away in opposing directions, Forest Hill and Sydenham stations offer services from both London Overground and Southern Rail some of the following travel times are available:London Bridge in approximately 17 minutes.Canary Wharf in approximately in 23 minutes.Shoreditch High Street in approximately 22 minutes.Victoria station in approximately 30 minutes.Alongside the train links you will find several bus routes from along Mayow Road and on the South Circular which includes routes 122 and 185 to Crystal Palace and Victoria to name a few.Local recreation:Mayow Park located along Mayow Road itself is a very popular green space located approximately 0.1 miles from the property. It???s well known for its caf?? as well as a bowling green, outdoor gym, water feature, nature reserve, tennis courts, cricket pitch and meadow area to name a few highlights.Off the high street in Forest Hill town centre you'll find Forest Hill pools and library both of which have undergone refurbishment. Forest Hill pools is known for its swimming pool facilities but is also a local leisure centre with a gym and fitness classes.The Horniman Museum and Gardens is a well-known local point of interest and can be found just beyond the town centre.
