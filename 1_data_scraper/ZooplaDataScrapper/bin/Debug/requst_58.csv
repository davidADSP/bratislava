Honestly, this is no exaggeration, if you want something, you???ll likely find it not too far from the station. The market, the longest in Europe, is busy and thriving. Pick up fresh fruit and veg, or visit the rotisserie stall on a Saturday for the best pork or chicken baguettes in town. Next to the market we have a shopping centre packed with high street names, and right at the top of the High Street you???ll find our new cinema and retail complex. Called the Scene, it is home to a ten screen Empire cinema, Pizza Express, and loads of other bars and restaurants. Just around the corner from this new cinema, is a very old one. The Granada opened in 1930, and after a long campaign by local residents it has recently reopened as a bar and live music venue. Now called Mirth, Marvel and Maud, this building is simply stunning. The hustle and bustle of the High Street is contrasted by the quiet residential streets that surround it. This part of Walthamstow really gives you the best of both worlds, a shopping hub, nightlife, and peace and quiet at home.Dimensions:Communal EntranceDoor To Flat.EntranceVia front door leading into:Entrance HallwayDoor To Lounge/Kitchen, Bedroom One & Bathroom.Lounge/Kitchen (5.74m x 3.12m (18'10 x 10'3))Bedroom One (3.53m x 3.25m (11'7 x 10'8))Bedroom Two (3.40m x 2.01m (11'2 x 6'7))Bathroom (2.16m x 2.08m (7'1 x 6'10))Gladioli House, Carisbrooke Road, Walthamstow, London E17;2017-03-29 11:59:25;https://li.zoocdn.com/6530f2729b32b6e5f676527bdcb230c57d3c4760_354_255.jpg;2017-03-30 01:43:28;51.58326;51.58326;sale;-0.032748;false;1;2;0;1;E17;London;365000;;Flat;for_sale;Gladioli House43383235;Lanes;020 3641 7657;Residential;Great Cambridge Gardens is a modern contemporary development of just 4 spacious five bedroom town houses, finished to very high specification.
