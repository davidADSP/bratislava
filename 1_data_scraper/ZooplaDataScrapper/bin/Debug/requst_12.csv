However, the stunning glass wall on the back of this house will ensure that, Summer or Winter, this house will always be flooded with light. This superb terraced house has been renovated to an exceptionally high standard throughout, and is ideally located for those who want to make their daily commute as pain free as possible. Perched just off Lea Bridge Road, the bus ride into the City couldn???t be easier, plus there is the added bonus of the newly re-opened Lea Bridge Station. But all work and no play is not a recipe for happiness. Fortunately, the location of this house scores highly there as well. Something to eat? Jump on the bus to Chatsworth Road, or head in the other direction to Leyton High Road or Walthamstow Village ??? plenty of choice on offer for even the most fickle foodie. Fancy some exercise? Head up to the ice rink for a leisurely skate, or perhaps venture to Brooks Farm and say hello to a sheep or two. If that sounds too active, you could settle for a stroll around Jack Cornwell Park ??? it???s literally on your doorstep.Living Here...The first thing you notice when you walk through the front door is the space. This is open plan living on an epic scale. The bay window to the front and the amazing glass wall to the rear ensure the ground floor kitchen/lounge/diner is flooded with light, whatever the time of day. If ever there was a house designed for entertaining this is it! The glass wall (that really is the only way to describe it) also offers uninterrupted views of the rear garden, which itself is another great space for entertaining guests in the Summer. On the first floor you find two bedrooms and two bathrooms (one of them en suite to the master bedroom), whilst the top floor boasts two further bedrooms, meaning plenty of room for even the largest family. This is a rare opportunity to purchase a truly wonderful property.In This Area...Leyton is home to the only shop that can be seen from space. Ok, that's not entirely true, but the carnival shop on the high road is definitely bright. There's no way you'll miss this multi coloured wonder, it looks like it's made of Lego. The shop sits opposite coronation gardens, a beautiful park with a little maze, pond and fountain. Walk all the way through coronation gardens and you'll find Leyton beach, yep, that's right, Leyton beach, former training ground for beach volley ball teams during the 2012 Olympics. The high road is also home to the Leyton technical, a lovely pub that occupies the ground floor of the old town hall. It has good beer, good food, and the longest walk to the toilet you'll ever find. If you like beer, Leyton is the place for you, as both Brodie's beers and the East London Brewing Company are based in E10. Sidmouth park, just behind the carnival shop, is a hit with kids as there's loads of stuff to play on. If you are hungry or thirsty, Wander to Francis road and you'll find a bucket load of nice cafes, including Yardarm, Marmelo Kitchen, and Albert & Francis.Dimensions:EntranceVia front door leading into:Entrance HallwayStaircase leading to first floor.
