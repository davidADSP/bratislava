Perched just off Lea Bridge Road, the bus ride into the City couldn???t be easier, plus there is the added bonus of the newly re-opened Lea Bridge Station. But all work and no play is not a recipe for happiness. Fortunately, the location of this house scores highly there as well. Something to eat? Jump on the bus to Chatsworth Road, or head in the other direction to Leyton High Road ??? plenty of choice on offer for even the most fickle foodies amongst you. Fancy some exercise? Head up to the ice rink for a leisurely skate, or perhaps head to the equestrian centre if four legs seem better than two blades. If that sounds too active, you could settle for a stroll around Leyton Manor Park ??? it???s literally on your doorstep.Living Here...We think this is a lovely house, and we are pretty sure you will too. The dual aspect lounge diner is the perfect place for entertaining family and friends, whilst the wide galley kitchen offers plenty of space in which to hone your culinary skills.

The icing on this property cake is the private rear garden ??? the perfect spot to relax with a cup of tea at the end of a hard day.In This Area - By Walthamstow DiaryLeyton is home to the only shop that can be seen from space. Ok, that's not entirely true, but the carnival shop on the high road is definitely bright. There's no way you'll miss this multi coloured wonder, it looks like it's made of Lego. The shop sits opposite coronation gardens, a beautiful park with a little maze, pond and fountain. Walk all the way through Coronation Gardens and you'll find Leyton beach, yep, that's right, Leyton beach, former training ground for beach volley ball teams during the 2012 Olympics. The high road is also home to the Leyton technical, a lovely pub that occupies the ground floor of the old town hall. It has good beer, good food, and the longest walk to the toilet you'll ever find. If you like beer, Leyton is the place for you, as both Brodie's beers and the East London Brewing Company are based in E10. Sidmouth Park, just behind the carnival shop, is a hit with kids as there's loads of stuff to play on. If you are hungry or thirsty, wander to Francis road and you'll find a bucket load of nice cafes, including Yardarm, Marmelo Kitchen, and Albert & Francis.EntranceVia front door leading into:Entrnace HallwayOpen To:Lounge/Diner (7.47m x 4.29m (24'6 x 14'1))Staircase leading to first floor.

Entering through the porch and the solid wooden front door the hallway immediately sets the tone of what to expect  strong period influences. The decorative staircase leads you up to the first floor and the proceeding three first floor bedrooms and family bathroom. The bathroom is a luxurious centre piece with heritage colours, chrome trimmed sanitary ware and a deep roll top bath in which to soak the day s worries away.Back onto the ground floor and the original two reception rooms (lounge and dining room) have both been enhanced by additions of the conservatory off the lounge and the home office/fourth bedroom leading off the dining/reception room. It is the flexibility that this layout affords which is of most interest. The modern fitted kitchen, with its additional dining area, is spacious in length, contains lots of storage and is another indication that this house is ready to move into. The last room of the house is the utility room and WC, two features which every house should have! The house feels large and rather unique in its decor. If you are bored with the current bland fashion tastes and want some depth in your living quarters then this house is for you.Externally, the garden has something for everyone whether it s the flower beds for the gardener, the seating areas for entertaining or the large garage for the hobbyist or car enthusiast.Wallington is located within Greater London (between Croydon and Sutton) and as such has the benefits of a short commute into the centre of London yet still retains some greenery in its surroundings. Local schooling is exceptional and draws interest from near and wide. However, this is just skimming the surface of this community in which some property dates back to the 16th Century. The high street is larger than the nearby norm (Sutton excluded) and includes banks, restaurants, several supermarkets, etc. For the dog walkers, the nearby park is minutes away.Entrance HallKitchenUtility Room With Shower / WCSitting RoomDining RoomConservatoryStudyStairs To First Floor LandingBedroom 1Bedroom 2Bedroom 3Family BathroomOutsideGardenGarageImportant note to purchasers:We endeavour to make our sales particulars accurate and reliable, however, they do not constitute or form part of an offer or any contract and none is to be relied upon as statements of representation or fact.
