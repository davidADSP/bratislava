White Lodge Close was the perfect balance for me, fast commuting time to London, lots of great shops, restaurants and bars within a short walking distance - arguably in the hub of a thriving area but with a tranquility and lush green lawns and communal gardens akin to living in the country.Coming home from a busy days work in London I enjoyed having a peaceful tranquil home to unwind in. Having a garage is invaluable, if like me, you love the outdoors. I used to love cycling especially on a sunday afternoon though the Banstead Downs in the thick of the countryside. I played golf on Epsom Downs which is only a short drive away and the garage gave me the extra storage space to keep up with my many hobbies and no longer had to have a set of golf clubs in the corner of my bedroom :D.I have an abundance of fond memories from the flat, I relocated through work and although I didn't envisage moving back to Sutton I couldn't bear to part with the flat - in this interim time it has rented easily, consistently and proved to be a good financial decision."Share of Freehold - approx 990+ yearsGround Rent - N/AService Charge (inc.

His childhood home is now the William Morris gallery, the only gallery on the face of the planet dedicated to his life and work. Lloyd park, in which the gallery stands, is named after another former resident of the Water House, Edward Lloyd, a publisher of penny dreadfuls. As well as having a medieval moat, playground and a cafe, the park is also home to some great local events, including the May Day dog show which shouldn't be missed. The best dressed dog round is amazing, one year it had a Star Wars theme, staffie princess Leah's competed against at-at Great Danes, it was glorious. The park is surrounded by quiet streets of ex Warner properties, the bell pub is around the corner from the gallery, and the cafes of Hoe Street are just a short trot away. Give Wyndwood art district a go, this little cafe has a lot going on, including a running club and exhibitions. Tommys tuck in cafe, opposite the park, is a good spot for a hangover fixing breakfast. All this is only a fifteen minute walk from the station.Dimensions:EntranceVia own front door leading into:Entrance HallwayStaircase leading to first floor.First Floor LandingDoors To All Rooms.Lounge (5.23m x 3.43m (17'2 x 11'3))Kitchen (2.82m x 2.41m (9'3 x 7'11))Bedroom One (3.56m x 3.43m (11'8 x 11'3))Bedroom Two (3.35m x 3.25m (11'0 x 10'8))BathroomRear Garden (Shared) (approx 12.19m (approx 40'))The information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of any offer or contract, nor may it be relied upon as representations or statements of fact.

Head down to Marmelo Kitchen. Need a glass of bubbly to celebrate something special?

You will fall in love with it from the moment your feet first touch the beautiful stripped floorboards in the hallway, and by the time you arrive at the quiet and peaceful rear garden you will be totally besotted. In between start and finish is a home that has quite clearly been crafted by the owners with great love and attention to detail. The lounge is flooded with light from the sash bay windows, highlighting the beautiful architrave work on the ceilings, and adding further richness of colour to the flooring. Directly behind is the bedroom, which is again beautifully presented, and offers views of the private rear garden. Exploring further, you come to the dining room, which has a modern kitchen directly to the rear, and which is the perfect space in which to entertain family and friends. The flat is completed by the elegant bathroom. A truly wonderful example of an Abrahams flat, and one that will, we are sure, sweep you off your feet.In This Area...Leytonstone, or Leyton-St-One as my friend calls it when she???s trying to sound posh, is the birth place and former home of Alfred Hitchcock. It gets its name, or the stone bit at least, from the Highstone mile marker which stands on Hollybush Hill. Bordering Walthamstow, Wanstead, Epping Forest, Leyton and Stratford, Leytonstone has a lot going on. Check out All You Read Is Love on Leytonstone High Road. This independent caf??, bar and bookshop is great spot to sit and while away the hours, they host loads of special events, and you can buy real books (none of those ebooks here). If you are a fan of Vietnamese food, wander down the High Road to Little Saigon, the salt and pepper squid is all kinds of amazing. The Northcote Arms, which is technically in Leyton, is a great pub with a real community feel. And If you want amazing views of the city, go on a tower tour at St John the Baptist Church. The tours don???t run all year around, so you???d need to keep an eye on their website for dates, but it???s well worth doing. The views are simply spectacular, especially at Sunset with the lights of the city set against the darkening sky.Dimensions:EntranceVia front door leading into:Entrance HallwayAccess To Lounge/Bedroom One, Lounge/Reception Two or Bedroom Two.Lounge/Recepton Two (3.66m x 2.69m (12'0 x 8'10))Access To Inner Hallway.

Located just off the Outer Circle and next to London Zoo, this leafy mooring site is a private community of 14 boats that is owned by the crt. However, only 5 of these are residential, giving you the right to live here full time.From the crt website: "An established mooring, the craft here have a historic right of successive assignability and so may be sold on the mooring meaning vacancies do not commonly arise." Current mooring fees are ??7,900 p.A. And the crt license is ??500 annually.The site has water and electricity hook up for each berth. There is a communal garden space with storage facilities for residents.Cumberland Basin has an envious location within the confines of Regent's Park and you won't find many mooring sites that are as picturesque and secluded but within walking distance of central London.
