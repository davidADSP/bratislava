If you???re looking for a home that you can put your own stamp on, this will certainly get your heart racing if you're not afraid to get out the paint brushes and use your imagination! The property retains its original layout so there is opportunity to knock walls through. Many owners in the local area have improved the square footage of their properties with fabulous extensions. The lounge is currently the heart of the home that will provide a wonderful area for you and the family to relax in. With a separate kitchen at the rear overlooking the enviably sized garden, this is the perfect set up and once you have modernised it you will be cooking up some culinary delights for all your friends and throwing a wonderful house warming party. If you were looking to knock the space into one, or extend, this would become an even more desirable family home! Any extension or building work carried out would of course need the relevant planning consent. All the bedrooms upstairs are a considerable size. Traditionally, the youngest member of the family is stuck with the ???box??? room, but I think it is safe to say the youngest member of the family will not be complaining! Don???t miss out on this opportunity to buy a great family house that just needs some 'tlc' and it will become a fabulous home.Please refer to the footnote regarding the services and appliances.What the Owner says:My mother lived at this house for many years, it was a very much treasured family home.

All properties are built to a high specification with quality fixtures and fittings, and all enjoy a concierge service. Most apartments boast waterside views and balconies, and many include integrated kitchen appliances.Situated just three minutes walk from Crossharbour DLR station, the development is ideal for professionals working in nearby Canary Wharf, as well as for accessing the many entertainment and leisure opportunities available locally, and in east and central London. For those working in the City of London, Bank is less than 20 minutes away via DLR.Canary Wharf DLR is three stops from the development, giving convenient access to a wealth of shops, restaurants, caf??s and bars, as well as the business district. High-street brands, independent retailers and designer boutiques can be found in the shopping malls of Canada Place, Jubilee Place, Cabot Place and Crossrail Place, while fine dining and casual restaurants offering dishes from around the world, are located throughout the area.London Underground Jubilee Line trains stop at Canary Wharf tube station, which is a few minutes walk from the DLR station. From here frequent services operate to central London???s Green Park and Bond Street to the west, and Stratford to the east, bringing celebrated shopping destinations such as Oxford Street, Regents Street, Marble Arch and Westfield Stratford City within easy reach. A Crossrail station at Canary Wharf is due to open in 2018 with trains linking to central London, Essex, Kent, Buckinghamshire and Berkshire.Despite being one of the uk???s most important financial centres and home to some of the tallest buildings in Europe ??? including 1 Canada Square, the iconic Canary Wharf Tower ??? Docklands is by no means bereft of green space. Jubilee Park lies above Canary Wharf tube station and a rooftop park has been created above the Crossrail station.Just 10 minutes walk from these new homes in Docklands, Mudchute Park and Farm is a nature reserve and working farm with equestrian facilities, while the adjacent Millwall Park offers cycling and running tracks and sports pitches.The O2 Arena at Greenwich Peninsula, a 15-minute car journey away, is a major live music and performance venue. It is part of the O2 entertainment complex, which also includes a multiplex cinema, bowling alley and restaurants.Greenwich is home to the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich Park and the Royal Observatory, while the town centre is popular for dining and shopping, with a historic market open six days a week.Major roads easily accessible from Dockside include the A102 and Blackwall Tunnel, and the A13 for east London and south Essex.For international and domestic air travel London City Airport can be reached in just over 10 minutes by car, or in less than 30 minutes by public transport.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43383503?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Stunning top floor penthouse home spread over 2 floors.

This part of Walthamstow really gives you the best of both worlds, a shopping hub, nightlife, and peace and quiet at home.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Dimensions:</strong></h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Communal Entrance</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Door To Flat.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Entrance</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Via front door leading into:</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Entrance Hallway</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Door To Lounge/Kitchen, Bedroom One &amp; Bathroom.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Lounge/Kitchen</strong> (5.74m x 3.12m (18'10 x 10'3))</h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Bedroom One</strong> (3.53m x 3.25m (11'7 x 10'8))</h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Bedroom Two</strong> (3.40m x 2.01m (11'2 x 6'7))</h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Bathroom</strong> (2.16m x 2.08m (7'1 x 6'10))</h3>","outcode":"E17","property_report_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/area-report/?listing_id=43383236&z_cmp=property%20report&z_con=get%20a%20report&z_med=propinfo%20link&z_src=ios-for-sale","image_645_430_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/6530f2729b32b6e5f676527bdcb230c57d3c4760_645_430.jpg","county":"London","price":"365000","listing_id":"43383236","image_caption":"1.Jpg","image_80_60_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/80/60/6530f2729b32b6e5f676527bdcb230c57d3c4760.jpg","status":"for_sale","agent_name":"Estates 17 Ltd","num_recepts":"1","country":"England","first_published_date":"2017-03-29 11:59:25","displayable_address":"Gladioli House, Carisbrooke Road, Walthamstow, London E17","price_modifier":"offers_in_region_of","floor_plan":["https://lc.zoocdn.com/6f0ade88fa870ae4ac68639521abf5e4a6e346f1.jpg"],"street_name":"Gladioli House","num_bathrooms":"1","agent_logo":"https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(156776).png","price_change":[{"direction":"","date":"2017-03-29 11:57:20","percent":"0%","price":"365000"}],"agent_phone":"020 7768 0484","image_354_255_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/6530f2729b32b6e5f676527bdcb230c57d3c4760_354_255.jpg","image_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/6530f2729b32b6e5f676527bdcb230c57d3c4760_354_255.jpg","last_published_date":"2017-03-30 01:43:28"},{"country_code":"gb","num_floors":"0","image_150_113_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/265d72510dcb9cb89c87228b35464133281977bb_150_113.jpg","listing_status":"sale","num_bedrooms":"5","image_50_38_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/265d72510dcb9cb89c87228b35464133281977bb_50_38.jpg","latitude":51.658573,"agent_address":"35 Church Street, Enfield","category":"Residential","property_type":"End terrace house","longitude":-0.060906,"thumbnail_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/265d72510dcb9cb89c87228b35464133281977bb_80_60.jpg","description":"Great Cambridge Gardens is a modern contemporary development of just 4 spacious five bedroom town houses, finished to very high specification.

All properties are built to a high specification with quality fixtures and fittings, and all enjoy a concierge service. Most apartments boast waterside views and balconies, and many include integrated kitchen appliances.Situated just three minutes walk from Crossharbour DLR station, the development is ideal for professionals working in nearby Canary Wharf, as well as for accessing the many entertainment and leisure opportunities available locally, and in east and central London. For those working in the City of London, Bank is less than 20 minutes away via DLR.Canary Wharf DLR is three stops from the development, giving convenient access to a wealth of shops, restaurants, caf??s and bars, as well as the business district. High-street brands, independent retailers and designer boutiques can be found in the shopping malls of Canada Place, Jubilee Place, Cabot Place and Crossrail Place, while fine dining and casual restaurants offering dishes from around the world, are located throughout the area.London Underground Jubilee Line trains stop at Canary Wharf tube station, which is a few minutes walk from the DLR station. From here frequent services operate to central London???s Green Park and Bond Street to the west, and Stratford to the east, bringing celebrated shopping destinations such as Oxford Street, Regents Street, Marble Arch and Westfield Stratford City within easy reach. A Crossrail station at Canary Wharf is due to open in 2018 with trains linking to central London, Essex, Kent, Buckinghamshire and Berkshire.Despite being one of the uk???s most important financial centres and home to some of the tallest buildings in Europe ??? including 1 Canada Square, the iconic Canary Wharf Tower ??? Docklands is by no means bereft of green space. Jubilee Park lies above Canary Wharf tube station and a rooftop park has been created above the Crossrail station.Just 10 minutes walk from these new homes in Docklands, Mudchute Park and Farm is a nature reserve and working farm with equestrian facilities, while the adjacent Millwall Park offers cycling and running tracks and sports pitches.The O2 Arena at Greenwich Peninsula, a 15-minute car journey away, is a major live music and performance venue.

All properties are built to a high specification with quality fixtures and fittings, and all enjoy a concierge service. Most apartments boast waterside views and balconies, and many include integrated kitchen appliances.Situated just three minutes walk from Crossharbour DLR station, the development is ideal for professionals working in nearby Canary Wharf, as well as for accessing the many entertainment and leisure opportunities available locally, and in east and central London. For those working in the City of London, Bank is less than 20 minutes away via DLR.Canary Wharf DLR is three stops from the development, giving convenient access to a wealth of shops, restaurants, caf??s and bars, as well as the business district. High-street brands, independent retailers and designer boutiques can be found in the shopping malls of Canada Place, Jubilee Place, Cabot Place and Crossrail Place, while fine dining and casual restaurants offering dishes from around the world, are located throughout the area.London Underground Jubilee Line trains stop at Canary Wharf tube station, which is a few minutes walk from the DLR station. From here frequent services operate to central London???s Green Park and Bond Street to the west, and Stratford to the east, bringing celebrated shopping destinations such as Oxford Street, Regents Street, Marble Arch and Westfield Stratford City within easy reach. A Crossrail station at Canary Wharf is due to open in 2018 with trains linking to central London, Essex, Kent, Buckinghamshire and Berkshire.Despite being one of the uk???s most important financial centres and home to some of the tallest buildings in Europe ??? including 1 Canada Square, the iconic Canary Wharf Tower ??? Docklands is by no means bereft of green space. Jubilee Park lies above Canary Wharf tube station and a rooftop park has been created above the Crossrail station.Just 10 minutes walk from these new homes in Docklands, Mudchute Park and Farm is a nature reserve and working farm with equestrian facilities, while the adjacent Millwall Park offers cycling and running tracks and sports pitches.The O2 Arena at Greenwich Peninsula, a 15-minute car journey away, is a major live music and performance venue. It is part of the O2 entertainment complex, which also includes a multiplex cinema, bowling alley and restaurants.Greenwich is home to the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich Park and the Royal Observatory, while the town centre is popular for dining and shopping, with a historic market open six days a week.Major roads easily accessible from Dockside include the A102 and Blackwall Tunnel, and the A13 for east London and south Essex.For international and domestic air travel London City Airport can be reached in just over 10 minutes by car, or in less than 30 minutes by public transport.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43383030?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Huge 915. 2 bedroom city apartment, just 5 mins from Canary Wharf with stunning waterside views and fantastic transport options on your doorstep.
