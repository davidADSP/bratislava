Are delighted to be marketing a rare Grade II listed Georgian terraced house moments from Waterloo and Southwark stations.The house forms part of the coveted Roupell Street Conservation Area, which contains some of the best-preserved Georgian terraces in London.Whittlesey Street is one of four streets developed between the 1820s and 1840s on what was previously marshland, farmland and gardens. The houses were built by local businessman John Roupell, who owned a lead smelting and scrap metal business in Bear Lane in Southwark. In all, John and his son Richard built 82 houses in four streets. Roupell Street still bears the family name but the others have been renamed. Whittlesey Street was originally called Catherine Street, after John's wife.This delightful home is a double fronted house with a double width, south facing garden. The house purports to be the largest house in the street, having benefited from a two-storey extension prior to being Grade II listed in the 1970s. It consists of three double bedrooms (one with en-suite bathroom), a large re-fitted eat-in kitchen, three reception rooms and a cinema room in the basement.The house is in fine condition having undergone a complete renovation programme in 2009. This included a new roof, re-pointing of walls, re-plastering, new electrical wiring and plumbing, new central heating with period radiators throughout, four newly installed fireplaces, refurbishment of original panelling, replacement doors and windows, new walnut engineered flooring to ground floor living, dining and snug areas and new carpet fitted to stairs and bedrooms.Freehold","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43401623?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Frank Harris &amp; Co.
