The location is so quiet as the house is in a cul de sac so it's lovely to come home after a day at work and relax in the garden or in the sauna without any distrubance. The layout downstairs is very sociable and great for entertaining and having two bathrooms and a downstairs toilet is very practical when friends come to stay. The location is excellent; we are equidistant to Forest Hill and Sydenham which both have some great shops, restaurants and bars not to mention that they both have superb transport links which makes commuting a doddle.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43479555?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Stunning end of terrace house boasting three bedrooms, two bathrooms, 18'5 kitchen/diner and a sauna finished impeccably throughout excellently located for Forest Hill, Sydenham and Sydenham Hill station Freehold","outcode":"SE26","property_report_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/area-report/?listing_id=43479555&z_cmp=property%20report&z_con=get%20a%20report&z_med=propinfo%20link&z_src=ios-for-sale","image_645_430_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/7423ca85f738087e44fc92cbea74700160b1d8ac.jpg","county":"London","price":"550000","listing_id":"43479555","image_caption":"Picture No. 03","image_80_60_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/7423ca85f738087e44fc92cbea74700160b1d8ac_80_60.jpg","status":"for_sale","agent_name":"Robinson Jackson - Sydenham","num_recepts":"0","country":"England","first_published_date":"2017-04-07 01:12:35","displayable_address":"Prospect Close, Sydenham, London SE26","price_modifier":"offers_over","floor_plan":["https://lc.zoocdn.com/efd258f0373306239582507ae8cefce8e0b920f9.jpg"],"street_name":"Sydenham London","num_bathrooms":"0","agent_logo":"https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(433629).png","price_change":[{"direction":"","date":"2017-04-06 16:07:26","percent":"0%","price":"550000"}],"agent_phone":"020 3478 3507","image_354_255_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/7423ca85f738087e44fc92cbea74700160b1d8ac.jpg","image_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/7423ca85f738087e44fc92cbea74700160b1d8ac.jpg","last_published_date":"2017-04-07 01:18:53"},{"country_code":"gb","num_floors":"0","image_150_113_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/1299c8d26b594df62f83cd4bd6aef9830a659dea_150_113.jpg","listing_status":"sale","num_bedrooms":"2","image_50_38_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/1299c8d26b594df62f83cd4bd6aef9830a659dea_50_38.jpg","latitude":51.434727,"agent_address":"256 Kirkdale, London","category":"Residential","property_type":"Maisonette","longitude":-0.050991,"thumbnail_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/1299c8d26b594df62f83cd4bd6aef9830a659dea_80_60.jpg","description":"Superb two bedroom share of freehold maisonette with 15' reception and private garden tucked away on a quiet tree lined road excellently located for the award winning Mayow Park and Forest Hill station/ellInteriorEntrance Hall    Double glazed window to side, carpet, radiatorLounge    Double glazed window to rear, carpet, radiatorKitchen    Double glazed window to front, range of wall and base units, stainless steel sink unit with drainer, integrated oven, hob and extractor, space for fridge/freezer, plumbed for washing machine, vinyl floorBedroom One    Double glazed window to rear, carpet, radiatorBedroom Two    Double glazed window to front, three built cupboards, carpet, radiatorBathroom    Double glazed window to front, panelled bath, mixer tap with shower attachment, pedestal wash hand basin, low flush wc, tiled floor, radiatorExteriorPrivate garden mainly laid to lawn with plants and shrubsAdditional Information15' receptionUpper floorAmple storageDouble glazingSought after locationIdeal for the award winning Mayow ParkOwners CommentWe have enjoyed living here for many years.

Details of these fees are as follows:<br><br>Administration Fees (Non-optional)<br>We charge ??150 (including VAT) to cover the cost of administration of the tenancy. For clarity, this is a charge per tenancy and not per applicant.<br><br>Referencing Fees (Non-optional)<br>We use an independent referencing agency (rmt - Reference-My-Tenant) to carry out reference checks on all tenants. The cost of these checks are ??35 (including VAT) per individual joining the tenancy and ??50 (including VAT) if a company is being referenced. For clarity, each individual named in the tenancy agreement will need to pay a referencing fee. For example, 3 tenants = 3 referencing fees.<br><br>Check-In Fees (Non optional in the event that the Landlord uses the services of an Independent Inventory Clerk)<br>We use an independent inventory company (normally Ready Report) to carry out a Check-In and Check-Out service on all properties (subject to the landlord confirming that they wish to use this service). The cost of a check-in and check-out are identical and can vary from ??108 (including VAT) to ??240 (including VAT) dependent on the size of property and the amount of furnishings in the property. Most normally, tenants pay for a check-in and landlords pay for the check-out. For clarity, check in fees are payable per tenancy, not per applicant.<br><br>Early Termination (Non-optional in the event of leaving earlier than the tenancy allows)<br><br>A fundamental responsibility as a tenant is to pay your rent, but we recognize there may be circumstances whereby you need to break out of your tenancy early. If your Landlord agrees that the property can be re advertised, in order to find a suitable replacement tenant to take over your liability, you still need to continue making your regular rent payments until a new tenant takes occupation. In addition you will need to cover the Landlords fees for the unexpired term of your tenancy. These fees are calculated on a pro rata basis. Should you be thinking of leaving earlier than your tenancy agreement permits, you should contact your local branch as soon as possible for a detailed breakdown of the costs involved.<br><br>Other Fees<br><br>Currell also works on behalf of institutional, rather than private, Landlords who may have their own administration procedures and fees. This can mean that the costs vary from those detailed above. Details of these fees are available upon request, but please be assured that if these landlords charge fees then you will not be liable to pay any fees to us.","longitude":-0.085829,"thumbnail_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/d24a89a1bad39c23690c1ac0029db1222499f9ba_80_60.jpg","description":" Key features: ???

From moving in as a tenant, I then bought the flat 6 years ago because the location is just perfect - it's quiet and peaceful in the evenings and at weekends, but close to Canary Wharf Jubilee Line/DLR providing quick and easy access to central London. Canary Wharf is just 15 minutes walk away with its vast range of shops, bars, restaurants, gyms, 2 cinemas all at your convenience. Westfield shopping centre, the Olympic Park and the O2 arena are also only a short tube/DLR journey. With the flat being located along the Thames River Walk, there is easy access to the exceptional pubs in Limehouse and surrounding basin, along with being a short walk away, through the foot tunnel to the historical area of Greenwich. Having the well sized balcony has provided that outdoor space to enjoy summer evenings watching the world go by on the river but also taking in the London skyline overlooking the Shard. I have very much enjoyed my time living in the flat, and whilst a new adventure awaits, I will always look back on this flat as my oasis in the middle of London.\"","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43478946?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"This stunning one double bedroom apartment just has to be viewed.

It was designed and built by Sir Terence Conran and then fitted out by Berkeley.The living space spans a huge 1,750 square feet and the high ceilings make it feel even larger. All three bedrooms are comfortable doubles and two of them have a river view. The master suite has a large bathroom and a walk in wardrobe. There are wood floors throughout and ample storage.
