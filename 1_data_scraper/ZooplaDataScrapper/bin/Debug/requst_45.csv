With Henry Maynard School opposite the family home it won't be far to walk the children into school in the morning, and picking up won't be much bother either! Literally a pebble???s throw from Orford Road, every imaginable amenity is on your doorstep. Need a pint of milk (and maybe grab a few freshly baked pastries for a Sunday morning)? Then pop into the award winning Spar. Need a bottle of bubbly or wine for the soon approaching Summer bbq's? In Vito Veritas will have the very thing you need. Don???t think the location of this house is just convenient for enjoying yourself (although of course that is very important). When the weekend ends and work eventually calls, it???s just a short stroll down to Walthamstow Central station for the commute into the City. Need a coffee for the morning walk to the station, have you pick of many down Orford Road or Huck???s on Grove Road who will be able to satisfy even the most voracious of caffeine cravings. This house is in a great spot for family life, schools, shops and transport what more can you ask for? Oh and don???t forget the gorgeous street it sits on!Living Here...Ever walked into a house and it just felt like it was somewhere you would really love to live? Well, that???s how we felt when we walked through the front door of this house, and we are pretty sure you will too. Walking into the bay fronted through lounge it is the perfect spot in which to relax, and equally a great place to entertain. Walking down the hallway into the kitchen, (which also boasts a bay window) feels like a breath of fresh air as the room is instantly flooded with sunlight. Moving upwards, there are three good size double bedrooms and family bathroom on the first floor, whilst the house itself is a good size there is potential to extend stpp, in the loft to add another two bedrooms along with en-suite, then for the ground floor with a variety of choices to extend the kitchen. And don???t forget the 50' private rear garden ??? ideal for relaxing or partying through the summer nights.In This Area - By Walthamstow DiaryDespite what people may tell you, Walthamstow Village was not invented by estate agents. It???s called Walthamstow Village because it was once exactly that, a village. Once the administrative heart of Walthamstow, the Village is now content to simply be the neon capital of Europe. An unlikely claim you might think, but visit God???s Own Junkyard on Ravenswood industrial estate and you???ll see what I mean.When your mind has been blown by the neon, pop in to Mother???s Ruin Gin Palace and Wildcard Brewery. All three businesses are based on Ravenswood, making it the most exciting industrial estate on the planet. The Village is full of quiet residential streets that all have easy access to bucket loads of pubs and restaurants. Take in the Jazz at the Nags Head on Sunday afternoon, enjoy the excellent food and beer at the Queen???s Arms, and sample the legendary chicken and bacon jam burger at Eat17.To walk off all the food you???ve eaten, wander to the 15th century Ancient House, check out St Mary???s Church and its ivy clad church yard, have a pint in the garden at the Castle Pub, then admire the art in the windows of the old iron mongers.Dimensions:EntranceVia front door leading into:Entrance HallwayDoor To:Reception Room One (3.96m x 3.35m (13'0 x 11'0))Reception Room Two (3.45m x 2.59m (11'4 x 8'6))Kitchen/Diner (4.60m x 3.35m (15'1 x 11'0))Door To Rear Garden.First Floor LandingDoor To All First Floor Rooms.Bedroom One (4.42m x 3.35m (14'6 x 11'0))Bedroom Two (3.66m x 2.67m (12'0 x 8'9))Bedroom Three (3.35m x 2.74m (11'0 x 9'0))First Floor Bathroom (2.74m x 1.52m (9'0 x 5'0))Rear Garden (South-Facing) (approx 15.24m (approx 50'))The information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of any offer or contract, nor may it be relied upon as representations or statements of fact.
