So when a property comes on that matches this criteria, it often comes with problems or needs so much work that your budget just doesn't make it feasible. What if we offered you an apartment that was so well maintained that you would know instantly it has to be yours? This incredible home will give you just that! Situated pride of place in a sought after gated development, you are literally in the ideal location for the town centre as well as all three train stations. Sitting in the wonderful lounge you will love how bright and airy it is with plenty of natural light pouring through the windows and with a great outlook too. With room for a dining table and chairs as the space is great for when entertaining friends or relaxing. The kitchen is a good size and being just next to the lounge, means you can still converse with your guests as you prepare your meals. It has been re-modelled by the current owners and is somewhere stylish to get stuck into the recipe books. The double bedroom has built in wardrobes so all you need to worry about is the bed. The bathroom has also been upgraded by the current owners and is now the ideal place to relax with a well earned soak. Complete with communal gardens, you can soak up some sunshine and the allocated parking means you can leave the car at home and walk to the station.What the Owner says:I bought this flat as I really liked the location. It is positioned right in the heart of the town yet also feels tucked away at the same time and the fact that the development is gated, gave me the extra peace of mind that the block was secure and private. Over the years of living here, I have done a fair amount of work to the property. I have replaced the kitchen and bathroom, re-carpeted and re-decorated and also extended the lease. It's only the fact that I am moving closer to London that makes me want to sell. It would be a great first purchase or investment for someone.Room sizes:Entrance HallLounge 12'0 x 11'10 (3.66m x 3.61m)Kitchen 11'8 x 5'7 (3.56m x 1.70m)Bedroom 13'8 x 8'7 (4.17m x 2.62m)BathroomCommunal GardensAllocated ParkingVisitor ParkingThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.
