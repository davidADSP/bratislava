There is also the added advantage of the driveway at the front. Well located for the town, exceptional schools and the train station this exceptional, quality home has it all.What the Owner says:We bought this house 10 years ago and for us it was all about the location! We knew it was a great area - quiet and peaceful yet so close by to the local school, excellent transport links and shops.When we stepped inside we were blown away by the potential it offered. Over the years we have completely transformed it with everything having been done. We have extended both outwards and upwards and created a very spacious home in doing so. This was important to us as with four children, it was imperative that we had enough space for everyone. We also installed a new kitchen and replaced all three bathrooms as well as adding the plantation shutters and redecorating throughout. We have finished everything to the highest specification and have achieved our dream to create a lovely family home.Room sizes:Entrance HallLounge 15'3 x 13'6 (4.65m x 4.12m)Shower RoomUtility Area 13'9 x 9'5 (4.19m x 2.87m)Family Area 15'2 x 11'3 (4.63m x 3.43m)Kitchen/Dining Area 19'2 x 10'5 (5.85m x 3.18m)LandingBedroom 2 15'2 x 11'3 (4.63m x 3.43m)Bedroom 3 13'3 x 9'5 (4.04m x 2.87m)BathroomBedroom 1 14'1 x 13'8 (4.30m x 4.17m)Bedroom 6 12'2 x 6'10 (3.71m x 2.08m)Loft Space 13'5 x 11'7 (4.09m x 3.53m)Shower RoomBedroom 5 12'7 x 10'3 (3.84m x 3.13m)Bedroom 4 12'8 x 10'2 (3.86m x 3.10m)DrivewayFront GardenRear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.
