It is easy to see why this is rapidly becoming one of Walthamstow???s most popular areas. With Lloyd Park literally on your doorstep, you can satisfy your artistic curiosity at the William Morris Gallery, take a spot of exercise on the tennis courts or bowling greens, and you???ll still have time to pop into The Bell for a quick drink and bite to eat before heading back to your lovely home. Why live anywhere else?Living Here...You will be hard tried to find a first floor warner flat as exceptional as this one. From the light and airy lounge, with its handsome stripped wood floor, through to the tastefully decorated fitted kitchen and stylish family bathroom, the communal parts of this flat are all beautifully detailed and thought through. The two bedrooms are both well proportioned, and the second of these to the rear offers views of the excellent rear garden, which is itself the perfect place to unwind when the Summer eventually returns.In This Area - By Walthamstow DiaryWilliam Morris was a Walthamstow lad, he lived in the Water House on Forest Road. His childhood home is now the William Morris gallery, the only gallery on the face of the planet dedicated to his life and work. Lloyd park, in which the gallery stands, is named after another former resident of the Water House, Edward Lloyd, a publisher of penny dreadfuls. As well as having a medieval moat, playground and a cafe, the park is also home to some great local events, including the May Day dog show which shouldn't be missed. The best dressed dog round is amazing, one year it had a Star Wars theme, staffie princess Leah's competed against at-at Great Danes, it was glorious. The park is surrounded by quiet streets of ex Warner properties, the bell pub is around the corner from the gallery, and the cafes of Hoe Street are just a short trot away. Give Wyndwood art district a go, this little cafe has a lot going on, including a running club and exhibitions. Tommys tuck in cafe, opposite the park, is a good spot for a hangover fixing breakfast. All this is only a fifteen minute walk from the station.Dimensions:EntranceVia own front door leading into:Entrance HallwayStaircase leading to first floor.First Floor LandingDoors To All Rooms.Lounge (5.23m x 3.43m (17'2 x 11'3))Kitchen (2.82m x 2.41m (9'3 x 7'11))Bedroom One (3.56m x 3.43m (11'8 x 11'3))Bedroom Two (3.35m x 3.25m (11'0 x 10'8))BathroomRear Garden (Shared) (approx 12.19m (approx 40'))The information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of any offer or contract, nor may it be relied upon as representations or statements of fact.

This charming two bedroom Warner flat has been finished to an exceptionally high standard with period features and vintage touches. It is easy to see why this is rapidly becoming one of Walthamstow???s most popular areas. With Lloyd Park literally on your doorstep, you can satisfy your artistic curiosity at the William Morris Gallery, take a spot of exercise on the tennis courts or bowling greens, and you???ll still have time to pop into The Bell for a quick drink and bite to eat before heading back to your lovely home. Why live anywhere else?</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Living Here...</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">You will be hard tried to find a first floor warner flat as exceptional as this one. From the light and airy lounge, with its handsome stripped wood floor, through to the tastefully decorated fitted kitchen and stylish family bathroom, the communal parts of this flat are all beautifully detailed and thought through. The two bedrooms are both well proportioned, and the second of these to the rear offers views of the excellent rear garden, which is itself the perfect place to unwind when the Summer eventually returns.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>In This Area - By Walthamstow Diary</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">William Morris was a Walthamstow lad, he lived in the Water House on Forest Road. His childhood home is now the William Morris gallery, the only gallery on the face of the planet dedicated to his life and work. Lloyd park, in which the gallery stands, is named after another former resident of the Water House, Edward Lloyd, a publisher of penny dreadfuls. As well as having a medieval moat, playground and a cafe, the park is also home to some great local events, including the May Day dog show which shouldn't be missed. The best dressed dog round is amazing, one year it had a Star Wars theme, staffie princess Leah's competed against at-at Great Danes, it was glorious. The park is surrounded by quiet streets of ex Warner properties, the bell pub is around the corner from the gallery, and the cafes of Hoe Street are just a short trot away. Give Wyndwood art district a go, this little cafe has a lot going on, including a running club and exhibitions. Tommys tuck in cafe, opposite the park, is a good spot for a hangover fixing breakfast. All this is only a fifteen minute walk from the station.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Dimensions:</strong></h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Entrance</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Via own front door leading into:</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Entrance Hallway</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Staircase leading to first floor.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>First Floor Landing</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Doors To All Rooms.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Lounge</strong> (5.23m x 3.43m (17'2 x 11'3))</h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Kitchen</strong> (2.82m x 2.41m (9'3 x 7'11))</h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Bedroom One</strong> (3.56m x 3.43m (11'8 x 11'3))</h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Bedroom Two</strong> (3.35m x 3.25m (11'0 x 10'8))</h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Bathroom</strong></h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Rear Garden (Shared)</strong> (approx 12.19m (approx 40'))</h3><p class=\"top\">The information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of any offer or contract, nor may it be relied upon as representations or statements of fact.

Literally a pebble???s throw from both the High Road and Francis Road, every imaginable amenity is on your doorstep. Feel in need of great food in convivial surroundings? Head down to Marmelo Kitchen. Need a glass of bubbly to celebrate something special? Dan and Eliza at Yardarm will have the very thing (and if you go to one of their tasting evenings you can learn about it as well as drink it)! Desperately need a coffee the next morning to deal with the hangover from all that fizz? Then Deeney???s on the High Road will be able to satisfy even the most voracious of caffeine cravings. And don???t get us started on the Veggie Wellington on Sundays at The Leyton Technical - amazing! But don???t think the location of this flat is just convenient for enjoying yourself (although of course that is very important). When the weekend sadly ends and work eventually calls, it???s just a short stroll down to Leyton tube station for the commute into the City.Living Here...If this garden flat was a film star, it would be Audrey Hepburn ??? cool, elegant, and very sophisticated. It just oozes confidence and charm, but in a quiet and understated way. You will fall in love with it from the moment your feet first touch the beautiful stripped floorboards in the hallway, and by the time you arrive at the quiet and peaceful rear garden you will be totally besotted. In between start and finish is a home that has quite clearly been crafted by the owners with great love and attention to detail. The lounge is flooded with light from the sash bay windows, highlighting the beautiful architrave work on the ceilings, and adding further richness of colour to the flooring. Directly behind is the bedroom, which is again beautifully presented, and offers views of the private rear garden. Exploring further, you come to the dining room, which has a modern kitchen directly to the rear, and which is the perfect space in which to entertain family and friends. The flat is completed by the elegant bathroom. A truly wonderful example of an Abrahams flat, and one that will, we are sure, sweep you off your feet.In This Area...Leytonstone, or Leyton-St-One as my friend calls it when she???s trying to sound posh, is the birth place and former home of Alfred Hitchcock. It gets its name, or the stone bit at least, from the Highstone mile marker which stands on Hollybush Hill. Bordering Walthamstow, Wanstead, Epping Forest, Leyton and Stratford, Leytonstone has a lot going on. Check out All You Read Is Love on Leytonstone High Road. This independent caf??, bar and bookshop is great spot to sit and while away the hours, they host loads of special events, and you can buy real books (none of those ebooks here). If you are a fan of Vietnamese food, wander down the High Road to Little Saigon, the salt and pepper squid is all kinds of amazing. The Northcote Arms, which is technically in Leyton, is a great pub with a real community feel. And If you want amazing views of the city, go on a tower tour at St John the Baptist Church. The tours don???t run all year around, so you???d need to keep an eye on their website for dates, but it???s well worth doing. The views are simply spectacular, especially at Sunset with the lights of the city set against the darkening sky.Dimensions:EntranceVia front door leading into:Entrance HallwayAccess To Lounge/Bedroom One, Lounge/Reception Two or Bedroom Two.Lounge/Recepton Two (3.66m x 2.69m (12'0 x 8'10))Access To Inner Hallway.

Literally a pebble???s throw from both the High Road and Francis Road, every imaginable amenity is on your doorstep. Feel in need of great food in convivial surroundings? Head down to Marmelo Kitchen. Need a glass of bubbly to celebrate something special? Dan and Eliza at Yardarm will have the very thing (and if you go to one of their tasting evenings you can learn about it as well as drink it)! Desperately need a coffee the next morning to deal with the hangover from all that fizz? Then Deeney???s on the High Road will be able to satisfy even the most voracious of caffeine cravings. And don???t get us started on the Veggie Wellington on Sundays at The Leyton Technical - amazing! But don???t think the location of this flat is just convenient for enjoying yourself (although of course that is very important). When the weekend sadly ends and work eventually calls, it???s just a short stroll down to Leyton tube station for the commute into the City.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Living Here...</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">If this garden flat was a film star, it would be Audrey Hepburn ??? cool, elegant, and very sophisticated. It just oozes confidence and charm, but in a quiet and understated way. You will fall in love with it from the moment your feet first touch the beautiful stripped floorboards in the hallway, and by the time you arrive at the quiet and peaceful rear garden you will be totally besotted. In between start and finish is a home that has quite clearly been crafted by the owners with great love and attention to detail. The lounge is flooded with light from the sash bay windows, highlighting the beautiful architrave work on the ceilings, and adding further richness of colour to the flooring. Directly behind is the bedroom, which is again beautifully presented, and offers views of the private rear garden. Exploring further, you come to the dining room, which has a modern kitchen directly to the rear, and which is the perfect space in which to entertain family and friends. The flat is completed by the elegant bathroom. A truly wonderful example of an Abrahams flat, and one that will, we are sure, sweep you off your feet.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>In This Area...</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Leytonstone, or Leyton-St-One as my friend calls it when she???s trying to sound posh, is the birth place and former home of Alfred Hitchcock. It gets its name, or the stone bit at least, from the Highstone mile marker which stands on Hollybush Hill. Bordering Walthamstow, Wanstead, Epping Forest, Leyton and Stratford, Leytonstone has a lot going on. Check out All You Read Is Love on Leytonstone High Road. This independent caf??, bar and bookshop is great spot to sit and while away the hours, they host loads of special events, and you can buy real books (none of those ebooks here). If you are a fan of Vietnamese food, wander down the High Road to Little Saigon, the salt and pepper squid is all kinds of amazing. The Northcote Arms, which is technically in Leyton, is a great pub with a real community feel. And If you want amazing views of the city, go on a tower tour at St John the Baptist Church. The tours don???t run all year around, so you???d need to keep an eye on their website for dates, but it???s well worth doing. The views are simply spectacular, especially at Sunset with the lights of the city set against the darkening sky.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Dimensions:</strong></h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Entrance</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Via front door leading into:</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Entrance Hallway</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Access To Lounge/Bedroom One, Lounge/Reception Two or Bedroom Two.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Lounge/Recepton Two</strong> (3.66m x 2.69m (12'0 x 8'10))</h3><p class=\"top\">Access To Inner Hallway.
