For clarity, this is a charge per tenancy and not per applicant.<br><br>Referencing Fees (Non-optional)<br>We use an independent referencing agency (rmt - Reference-My-Tenant) to carry out reference checks on all tenants. The cost of these checks are ??40 (including VAT) per individual joining the tenancy and ??50 (including VAT) if a company is being referenced. For clarity, each individual named in the tenancy agreement will need to pay a referencing fee. For example, 3 tenants = 3 referencing fees.<br><br>Check-In Fees (Non optional in the event that the Landlord uses the services of an Independent Inventory Clerk)<br>We use an independent inventory company (normally Ready Report) to carry out a Check-In and Check-Out service on all properties (subject to the landlord confirming that they wish to use this service). The cost of a check-in and check-out are identical and can vary from ??108 (including VAT) to ??240 (including VAT) dependent on the size of property and the amount of furnishings in the property. Most normally, tenants pay for a check-in and landlords pay for the check-out. For clarity, check in fees are payable per tenancy, not per applicant.<br><br>Early Termination (Non-optional in the event of leaving earlier than the tenancy allows)<br><br>A fundamental responsibility as a tenant is to pay your rent, but we recognize there may be circumstances whereby you need to break out of your tenancy early.

The two-bedroom house is one of a pair on a quiet gated mews that has been cleverly designed with a distinctive oval form by the architects Parritt Leng.The ground floor is largely given over to an open plan kitchen / living / dining room that is reached via an entrance hall (with a WC to one side). The main space incorporates a kitchen at one end and floor-to-ceiling glazed doors that run around the other end and open onto the decked, private garden. At the centre of the space is a spectacular steel and glass staircase that leads up to the first floor.The first floor features two largely identical bedrooms, both with en suite shower rooms and built in wardrobes.A decked garden, with raised beds, surrounds the house. At the front of the property is a shared courtyard area with one designated parking space. This is set back from the street behind electric gates.Parritt Leng are a London-based practice formed by James Parritt and Kuan Leng that focuses on sustainable projects across the UK. The following is their description of this project, which they call the Battersea Roundhouses:???Environmentally progressive design techniques and sustainably sourced materials have been of paramount importance from the outset. The landscaping scheme calmly merges the internal and external environments creating a sense of enhanced space??? Each house is clad in vertical stack bonded brickwork punctuated by flush timber windows. Internally a glass staircase floats in the centre of the house creating ease of circulation and central features. The roof is left open at its ridge point terminating in a circular glass window that floods the living spaces with natural light.???The mews is located behind Battersea High Street, just south of Battersea Square. The area has a broad range of popular shops, restaurants, bars and cafes. Clapham Junction is the nearest train station (less than ten minutes walk) and a number of buses go from nearby into the West End and Chelsea. Transport links will soon be enhanced by the proposed extension of the Northern Line to Battersea following the planned regeneration of Battersea Power Station and Nine Elms. One of London???s best loved parks, Battersea Park, is close by.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/40339321?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"This is a rare opportunity to purchase a freehold, detached property with off-street parking in Battersea.

Details of these fees are as follows:<br><br>Administration Fees (Non-optional)<br>We charge ??240 (including VAT) to cover the cost of administration of the tenancy. For clarity, this is a charge per tenancy and not per applicant.<br><br>Referencing Fees (Non-optional)<br>We use an independent referencing agency (rmt - Reference-My-Tenant) to carry out reference checks on all tenants. The cost of these checks are ??40 (including VAT) per individual joining the tenancy and ??50 (including VAT) if a company is being referenced. For clarity, each individual named in the tenancy agreement will need to pay a referencing fee. For example, 3 tenants = 3 referencing fees.<br><br>Check-In Fees (Non optional in the event that the Landlord uses the services of an Independent Inventory Clerk)<br>We use an independent inventory company (normally Ready Report) to carry out a Check-In and Check-Out service on all properties (subject to the landlord confirming that they wish to use this service). The cost of a check-in and check-out are identical and can vary from ??108 (including VAT) to ??240 (including VAT) dependent on the size of property and the amount of furnishings in the property. Most normally, tenants pay for a check-in and landlords pay for the check-out. For clarity, check in fees are payable per tenancy, not per applicant.<br><br>Early Termination (Non-optional in the event of leaving earlier than the tenancy allows)<br><br>A fundamental responsibility as a tenant is to pay your rent, but we recognize there may be circumstances whereby you need to break out of your tenancy early. If your Landlord agrees that the property can be re advertised, in order to find a suitable replacement tenant to take over your liability, you still need to continue making your regular rent payments until a new tenant takes occupation. In addition you will need to cover the Landlords fees for the unexpired term of your tenancy. These fees are calculated on a pro rata basis. Should you be thinking of leaving earlier than your tenancy agreement permits, you should contact your local branch as soon as possible for a detailed breakdown of the costs involved.<br><br>Other Fees<br><br>Currell also works on behalf of institutional, rather than private, Landlords who may have their own administration procedures and fees. This can mean that the costs vary from those detailed above. Details of these fees are available upon request, but please be assured that if these landlords charge fees then you will not be liable to pay any fees to us.","longitude":-0.085308,"thumbnail_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/80/60/a37445c1e76f03c911206e933293d99278a05e31.jpg","description":" Key features: ???
