Solid timber floors run throughout these rooms and the bathroom has impressive ceramic tiling, bath, over-sized rain shower head and additional hand-held shower attachment. The larger of these two bedrooms could be reconfigured at a later date to make an extra bedroom if needed, bringing the potential total to four bedrooms. The top floor is home to an impressive master suite with fitted wardrobes, a private terrace and a stylish en suite bathroom.There is access to this development from Hindsleys Place making the many local amenities easily utilised.
