The sense of space where the Thames stretches to almost a mile wide, and the broad flat land of the docks opens up great expanses of sky, is like nowhere else in the city. Either side of Royal Wharf there are large parks, adding an even greater sense of natural openness. To the east is Lyle Park, opened in 1924 by Sir Leonard Lyle. To the west are the 22 acres of the award-winning Thames Barrier Park, filled with fountains, lawns and flower gardens, as well as a children play area and sports facilities.Together with Royal Wharf Gardens, there will be a world-class fitnessclub, fully equipped to meet the varying needs of everyone at Royal Wharf. The excitement, delight and rewards of sport create a perfect platform for bringing people together. Its position by the park means the fitness club's expert staff will be able to take lessons and training beyond the four walls and into the outdoors. From yoga sessions under the trees to circuit training around the lawns, the park is an ideal space for sports and exercise. More widely, the site is criss-crossed by paths that encourage walking, running and cycling.Up and down the high street and throughout Royal Wharf, the shops, caf??s, bars and restaurants will do more than just serve a need.From townhouses to apartments, all of Royal Wharf's homes are infused with the aesthetic and values of new Georgian interiors. Residences are characterised by a sequence of spaces designed to a subtle hierarchy, carefully choreographed to give a clear sense of movement and change.The Royal Docks are a special focus for investment and opportunity. In 2010, a vision document by the Mayor of London described the future of the Royal Docks and identified ??22 billion of development potential for a new district on the north bank of the Thames. The huge investment in transport infrastructure, as well as surging demand from Canary Wharf services, means that vision swiftly becoming reality.The DLR rail line links the site to the Underground network and the whole of the capital. You can be at Bond Street in 20 minutes  and the O2 in a little over five. The Emirates cable car is a wonderful way to cross the Thames, gliding from the Royal Docks to the Greenwich Peninsula in seven minutes. Or why not take to the water on a Thames riverboat? And with London City Airport less than five minutes away by DLR, its quick and easy to fly all over Europe  or even to New York. Connections will get even better when Crossrail opens in 2018. Europe???s biggest engineering project, this pioneering service will link London and its neighbouring counties to the east and west. From Custom House station, close to Royal Wharf, it'll be just 15 minutes into central London. Even Heathrow airport will be less than 45 minutes away. It's hard to imagine a better time to be part of the story of London. Or a better place to do it than at Royal Wharf.Royal Wharf, N Woolwich Road, London E16;2017-03-28 22:23:36;https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/f1c7d15b7dbc3a730de3f2cc425678ae21875f02.jpg;2017-03-30 14:04:43;51.50154;51.50154;sale;0.031696;true;2;3;0;0;E16;London;880000;;Flat;for_sale;Royal Wharf, N Woolwich Road42052526;Prestige Realty;020 7768 0826;Residential;Marina & Docks Views!
