All it will need are the finishing flourishes to reflect your personality. The high-quality kitchens are intelligently designed for practicality and ease of use. They will also make a style statement, drawing on bespoke Molteni or Asselle joinery styled with dark wood-veneer handle-less doors, marble worktops and mirrored splashbacks. Deluxe Miele (or equivalent) appliances will set the scene for definitive 21st century living, with the duplex apartments featuring dedicated utility rooms with equally high-quality washing appliances.SituationKensington is on the doorstep of London's most expansive green spaces. Hyde Park, Henry viii's former hunting ground, and Kensington Gardens, once the private gardens of the palace, combine to make almost 200 hectares of open space ??? larger than the Principality of Monaco. Nearby Holland Park is one of London's forgotten treasures, making it easy to escape from the noise of the city.OutsideThe development's nearest Underground station is High Street Kensington (in central Zone 1), served by the Circle and District tube lines that loop around the entire West End (14 mins) and City (24 mins), as well as giving access to Heathrow Airport. The lines also lead directly to major railway interchanges at Victoria, Blackfriars and Liverpool Street for national rail services, and King's Cross for international connections. Buses are also a favourite local option, getting you to Piccadilly Circus. By road, Kensington has major east-west links to both central London and Heathrow Airport.Additional InformationCall us between our extended opening hours of 6 - 10PM Monday to Thursday to arrange an appointment.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/38445619?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Spacious and beautifully conceived, the apartment interiors will be crafted to the most meticulous standards to showcase sophisticated design in every detail: The generous ceiling heights in primary rooms; high-quality polished marble, limestone and engineered timber flooring.","outcode":"W8","property_report_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/area-report/?listing_id=38445619&z_cmp=property%20report&z_con=get%20a%20report&z_med=propinfo%20link&z_src=ios-for-sale","image_645_430_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/bdbb36aed698a366461905257a94d174413be5d3_645_430.jpg","county":"London","price":"980000","listing_id":"38445619","image_caption":"Picture No. 07","image_80_60_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/80/60/bdbb36aed698a366461905257a94d174413be5d3.jpg","status":"for_sale","agent_name":"Hamptons International - Kensington Sales","num_recepts":"1","country":"England","first_published_date":"2017-03-24 15:46:32","displayable_address":"Kensington High Street, London W8","floor_plan":["https://lc.zoocdn.com/43f49559b6099ad2cb5a83944a646c1d53731df0.gif","https://lc.zoocdn.com/8b712fd3ab465b0990956e1fddbd3279002f1ad9.pdf"],"street_name":"London","num_bathrooms":"1","agent_logo":"https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(289800).png","price_change":[{"direction":"","date":"2017-03-24 14:53:50","percent":"0%","price":"980000"}],"agent_phone":"020 3544 7191","image_354_255_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/bdbb36aed698a366461905257a94d174413be5d3.jpg","image_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/bdbb36aed698a366461905257a94d174413be5d3.jpg","last_published_date":"2017-03-31 13:45:45"},{"country_code":"gb","num_floors":"0","image_150_113_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/150/113/b48cd5ad9b1aa5c5aaaf19bdd60c1639369c6566.jpg","listing_status":"sale","num_bedrooms":"2","image_50_38_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/b48cd5ad9b1aa5c5aaaf19bdd60c1639369c6566_50_38.jpg","latitude":51.39381,"agent_address":"26 Claremont Road, Surbiton","category":"Residential","property_type":"Flat","letting_fees":"Fees apply<br><br>Tenant Fees &amp; Charges<br><br>Mandatory charges associated with the setting up of your tenancy<br><br>There are various fees and charges associated with renting a property that you should be aware of when considering making an offer on a property.

Expanding rapidly, London Borough of Newham is quickly becoming an extension of its neighbours. Already boasting an impressive number of ambitious projects such as the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and Westfield Stratford City, the area is one of the most engaging and increasingly exciting places in the country. The ??3.8 billion investment into Discovery Tower, Hallsville Quarter and London Borough of Newham, along with the wholesale development of The Docks, means where industry once blossomed, culture and business now flourishes.The thriving pulse of Canning Town, Hallsville Quarter will have a buzz and a bustle all of its own.
