Grange Hall was once a Victorian school, and its conversion has carefully combined excellence in contemporary design, building technology, materials and styling to create impeccably thought-out, practical homes.Each home is peppered with original period features, and this is reflected in their names. The Lancet is so called for its double-height pointed arch window  The Gables, because of its gable-end frontage  The Folly refers to the school's original arched vestibule  Mews Terrace North and South reflect their secluded location to the side of Grange Hall  and the two Nooks, Little and Big, celebrating alcoves that were serendipitously uncovered during construction. The Grange is the name given to the grandest house in the development because it occupies the entire front of the original Georgian school building.Each home is absolutely unique and different from its neighbour.Evering Road, London N16;2017-03-29 22:54:59;https://li.zoocdn.com/75ea01d56185647bc6593696f193fbda7eb56733_354_255.jpg;2017-03-30 20:34:12;51.55734;51.55734;sale;-0.073697;true;3;3;0;1;N16;London;1225000;;;for_sale;London43389487;Hamptons International - New Homes;020 3463 9984;Residential;A stunning 2 bedroom apartment offering open plan flexible kitchen-living space.
