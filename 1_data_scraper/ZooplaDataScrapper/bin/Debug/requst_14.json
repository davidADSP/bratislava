On the upper floor, the apartment consists of a generous reception, separate dining room and fully fitted kitchen, with plans previously approved to convert the space to spectacular open plan living. On the lower level, the apartment has a well-proportioned master bedroom with built in storage and en-suite bathroom, two further double bedrooms and an additional family bathroom.New River Head was the headquarters of the Metropolitan Water Board and was built in the 1920's by Herbert Austen Hall on the site of the reservoir opened in 1613 by Sir Hugh Myddleton. It was Grade II listed in 1950 by English Heritage. The remains can be clearly seen in the grounds, while the paneled 17th century Oak Room, transferred from the original building in its entirety, can be hired by tenants for dinners and functions.New River Head benefits from a 7-day concierge, beautiful communal gardens, gym and access to the very impressive Oak Room. Exmouth Market is a couple of minutes' walk away with a great selection of bars, restaurants, cafes and a local supermarket. The Angel, Shoreditch, Bloomsbury and Farringdon areas are all very close by.

Details of these fees are as follows:<br><br>Administration Fees (Non-optional)<br>We charge ??150 (including VAT) to cover the cost of administration of the tenancy. For clarity, this is a charge per tenancy and not per applicant.<br><br>Referencing Fees (Non-optional)<br>We use an independent referencing agency (rmt - Reference-My-Tenant) to carry out reference checks on all tenants. The cost of these checks are ??35 (including VAT) per individual joining the tenancy and ??50 (including VAT) if a company is being referenced. For clarity, each individual named in the tenancy agreement will need to pay a referencing fee. For example, 3 tenants = 3 referencing fees.<br><br>Check-In Fees (Non optional in the event that the Landlord uses the services of an Independent Inventory Clerk)<br>We use an independent inventory company (normally Ready Report) to carry out a Check-In and Check-Out service on all properties (subject to the landlord confirming that they wish to use this service). The cost of a check-in and check-out are identical and can vary from ??108 (including VAT) to ??240 (including VAT) dependent on the size of property and the amount of furnishings in the property. Most normally, tenants pay for a check-in and landlords pay for the check-out. For clarity, check in fees are payable per tenancy, not per applicant.<br><br>Early Termination (Non-optional in the event of leaving earlier than the tenancy allows)<br><br>A fundamental responsibility as a tenant is to pay your rent, but we recognize there may be circumstances whereby you need to break out of your tenancy early. If your Landlord agrees that the property can be re advertised, in order to find a suitable replacement tenant to take over your liability, you still need to continue making your regular rent payments until a new tenant takes occupation. In addition you will need to cover the Landlords fees for the unexpired term of your tenancy. These fees are calculated on a pro rata basis. Should you be thinking of leaving earlier than your tenancy agreement permits, you should contact your local branch as soon as possible for a detailed breakdown of the costs involved.<br><br>Other Fees<br><br>Currell also works on behalf of institutional, rather than private, Landlords who may have their own administration procedures and fees.
