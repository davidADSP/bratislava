You???re a short walk from all things Bellenden Road and also from Peckham Rye Station (7mins) for Overground and main line services. Chain free.

On entry, a contemporary, windowed shower room sits off to your left. In the main part of the flat you have a fresh, white, modern kitchen with plenty of cupboard space and wooden counters; this area is open-plan to the reception room (with an independent area that???s nearly 10ft by 8ft), with pretty Victorian fireplace on the internal wall. A huge sash window, opposite the fireplace, is a very welcome feature. We also love the pendant lights and solid wooden floors. The flat???s also really light owing to its south-westerly orientation. Beyond the reception area, folding doors open to the bedroom section. A large, square window looks out onto the communal garden and outdoor swimming pool for the exclusive use of residents of Warwick Gardens House (you've secure gated access via the side of the building).Locations don???t get much prettier, more desirable or better connected.
