It's a perfect location to access central London but yet has the benefits of a quiet neighbourhood. With a Tesco nearby and continued investment in the area more restaurants have opened up and continue to do so. Low maintenance and cost efficient to run. I will be sorry to say goodbye but moving more into the country, it's time for someone else to make their home.South Bermondsey station is accessible through the back of the development by way of a small footbridge which connects up to the path leading to the station.
