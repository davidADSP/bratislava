The hard wood parquet flooring is brand new and has sub floor and sound proof insulation replaced when it was fitted. The hard wood oak Victorian fire doors with antique brass finished handles are simply stunning and the brand new handmade Victorian style radiators, which you will find throughout the flat are exquisite. The new bathroom has been fully reconfigured and re-insulated and comes complete with a power shower and heated towel rails. The new bespoke designed kitchen comes with all appliances which are new and under warranty, including the cooker and hob. The flat has been completely re-wired and comes with a brand new boiler. The new sash windows are English heritage grade which are exclusively fitted in listed buildings which have been renovated. These have been completed to the highest specification and include brass locks and handles.This London loft style apartment is at the end of terrace and is therefore flooded with natural light from the windows which wrap around the whole flat.
