It is easy to see why this is rapidly becoming one of Walthamstow???s most popular areas. With Lloyd Park literally on your doorstep, you can satisfy your artistic curiosity at the William Morris Gallery, take a spot of exercise on the tennis courts or bowling greens, and you???ll still have time to pop into The Bell for a quick drink and bite to eat before heading back to your lovely home. Why live anywhere else?Living Here...This lovely ground floor Warner maisonette is perched on the very edge of Lloyd Park, and we think it is the perfect home, whatever the weather throws at you. Imagine sitting in the front lounge in the middle of winter, toasting your feet in front of the log burner, whilst the weather howls outside. Or if it???s Summer, then how about relaxing in the rear garden, perhaps whilst entertaining friends and family with your bbq skills? In between front and back, there???s plenty more packed into this flat, with two double bedrooms, a fitted kitchen (with access to the garden) and the family bathroom. All in all, a great flat, whatever the time of year.In This Area - By Walthamstow DiaryWilliam Morris was a Walthamstow lad, he lived in the Water House on Forest Road. His childhood home is now the William Morris Gallery, the only gallery on the face of the planet dedicated to his life and work. Lloyd Park, in which the gallery stands, is named after another former resident of the Water House, Edward Lloyd, a publisher of penny dreadfuls. As well as having a medieval moat, playground and a cafe, the park is also home to some great local events, including the May Day dog show which shouldn???t be missed. The best dressed dog round is amazing, one year it had a Star Wars theme, staffie princess Leahs competed against at-at Great Danes, it was glorious.The park is surrounded by quiet streets of ex Warner properties, The Bell pub is around the corner from the gallery, and the cafes of Hoe Street are just a short trot away. Give Wynwood art district a go, this little cafe has a lot going on, including a running club and exhibitions. Tommys tuck in cafe, opposite the park, is a good spot for a hangover fixing breakfast. All this is only a fifteen minute walk from the station.Dimensions:EntranceVia front door leading into:Entrance HallwayDoors To All Rooms.Lounge (4.14m x 3.28m (13'7 x 10'9))Kitchen (2.64m x 2.39m (8'8 x 7'10))Access To Rear Garden.Bedroom One (3.71m x 3.43m (12'2 x 11'3))Bedroom Two (3.28m x 3.18m (10'9 x 10'5))Bathroom (2.64m x 2.59m (8'8 x 8'6))Rear Garden (Shared) (approx 15.24m (approx 50'))The information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of any offer or contract, nor may it be relied upon as representations or statements of fact.
