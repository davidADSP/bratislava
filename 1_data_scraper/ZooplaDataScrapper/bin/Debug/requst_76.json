Natural light, space and entertaining are the key parts of this boat that make it such an exciting listing. The open plan galley and saloon has large windows and is a great living space for quiet weekends away or entertaining guests.The large cockpit provides even more space for friends to enjoy the fantastic views over the marina at Limehouse. Both cabins are beautifully appointed with double beds and adjoin to the bathroom which contains a shower cubicle and the washing machine and tumble dryer.The second cabin has a small bunk above the bed for a child. Throughout the boat, there is masses of storage space which is testament to the innovative design that came with the rebuild in 2000.The mechanical and electrical elements of this boat have received the same treatment in terms of money spent and the engine room is huge - there is a also small workshop in there. The 136HP daf engine was installed in 2008 and the owner tells me that it runs incredibly smoothly and barely uses any fuel. There is also a generator for longer trips away and a diesel powered central heating system.The mooring at Limehouse is transferable to the new owner after payment of a 5% fee to the marina management.

Impressive, modern apartment set on the 15th floor within a landmark building in the sought-after Greenwich Creekside development close to Greenwich town centre. The apartment consists of two spacious double bedrooms both with en suite bathrooms, floor to ceiling windows offering far reaching views and the master bedroom benefits from built-in wardrobes. Along the hallway there is a further WC and also a large walk-in storage cupboard. The hallway leads to the amazing open-plan 32'9 x 16' kitchen/reception room where you are greeted with floor to ceiling windows giving 270 degree panoramic views of the London skyline. The room naturally divides itself into a dining and living space and the 'Urban Myth' designed kitchen benefits from integrated appliances and breakfast bar. This area makes for a great entertaining space and gives access to the private balcony. The property also comes with a private allocated parking space. The development benefits from 24/7 concierge, basement bicycle storage and it is located only a short walk from Greenwich town centre and Cutty Sark DLR station (Canary Wharf in approx. 9 mins and Bank in around 21 mins). Please call to register your interest and book an immediate viewing.What the vendor says: \"We fell in love with the flat as soon as we saw the stunning views. Having lived here for over four years, I can honestly say it is impossible to get tired of the 270 degree views of the London skyline. As a large two bedroom penthouse, with two en suite bathrooms and floor to ceiling windows, we have found it a very light, airy and relaxing place to live. It is also very conveniently located. The DLR, overground and various bus routes are all less than a seven minute walk away, making it very convenient for travelling into Canary Wharf or central London for work. The flat is a stone's throw away from all the amenities of Greenwich town centre, as well as the beautiful park and the historic Cutty Sark and Maritime Museum. It is also very useful having a 24 hour concierge in the building.\"","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43351535?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Breathtaking views of the London skyline!
