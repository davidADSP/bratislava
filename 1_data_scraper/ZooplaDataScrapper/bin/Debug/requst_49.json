Whether you work from home, require some office space or just want some additional living space, the annexe in the rear garden will benefit almost all families.There are 3 bedrooms on the 1st floor plus a family bathroom with a state of the are bathtub/shower. There is also a 4th loft room, which has plenty of space and has a en-suite bathroom, allowing you to use this as your own private recluse.Bigger and better than your standard house, be sure to arrange a viewing quick before this house gets snapped up!What the Owner says:After spending years on building works and high quality materials, our house has now been made into a dream home.There is annexe in the garden, which has a lovely shower room, kitchen / lounge area and 2 additional rooms making it more like a 2 bedroom flat rather than an annexe. There is also a utility room and a prayer room in the garden.We are sad to be leaving this dream home but are sure the new owners will love living here as much as we have.Room sizes:Entrance HallLounge Area 15'8 x 11'4 (4.78m x 3.46m)Kitchen / Dining Area 26'4 x 19'2 (8.03m x 5.85m)LandingBedroom 1 15'9 x 11'11 (4.80m x 3.63m)Bedroom 2 14'8 x 10'1 (4.47m x 3.08m)Bedroom 3 6'10 x 6'10 (2.08m x 2.08m)Family BathroomLandingLoft RoomEn-Suite BathroomAnnexeEntranceKitchen / Lounge Area 13'3 x 12'5 (4.04m x 3.79m)Bedroom 1Bedroom 2Shower RoomGym 11'0 x 9'11 (3.36m x 3.02m)Off Road ParkingRear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

Whitworth House is situated just 0.3 miles from Elephant and Castle's underground and mainline stations. The apartment would benefit from some cosmetic work.  Wharton House is excellently located just a short walk to Maltby Street market, trendy Bermondsey Street, Borough market, The Old Vic, and the Globe. Living so centrally 1 means youre more likely to walk or cycle to your destination, but when you use the train, there are National Rail, Northern and Jubilee services from Nearby London Bridge and Bermondsey Stations.</p><p class=\"top\">These particulars are not intended to, and do not offer or form part of any contract and whilst these sales particulars are believed to be correct, their accuracy is in no way guaranteed.
