The property itself offers the opportunity to modernise to make an exceptional family home.Internally the downstairs accommodation comprises of entrance hall with access to downstairs WC and opening out into a huge 18 x 18'8 reception room with solid wood parquet floors & sliding glass doors opening to the garden.Not only do you have a separate 11'1 x 10'2 kitchen but this also leads onto to an extremely handy utility area. This space houses all the essential white goods and for drying washing. For the busy growing family this will be a dream space! There is also internal access to the garage from this room.The first floor offers three bedrooms and family bathroom. The two double bedrooms both have fitted wardrobes and both fairly equal in size. The smaller bedroom is still 9'8 in length and situated to the rear. The family bathroom is a good space and a key area that requires modernisation but potential buyers could add their own style.To the top floor we have another double bedroom measuring 18'7 x 13 with two dormer windows and fitted storage. With some clever reconfiguration this room could potentially incorporate an ensuite shower room.The garden is very secluded backing onto woodland and a patio space that would make an ideal bbq area. Currently arranged as raised beds but this is definitely an area that could be completely transformed.Tylney Avenue is just moments from the extremely popular Triangle and Gipsy Hill Station. Within easy reach of Sainsburys and the many facilities Crystal Palace has to offer, you will be spoilt for choice.Houses in this road rarely become available.
