We both work in the City, so being able to walk there in less than 30 minutes has been amazing. The location is great; the riverside pubs of Wapping are roughly just a 10 minute walk, Canary Wharf is less than 10 minutes on the DLR, Brick Lane and Shoreditch are about 15 minutes away on foot and the train lines at Shadwell can get you to so many places in such a short space of time such as Greenwich, Islington and Dalston. The flat is filled with light and the view across London is great ??? whatever the weather. The balcony is a real bonus; as the flat faces west you get to see some beautiful sunsets. The open plan lay-out is great for entertaining, there is a good selection of built-in storage and we had the bathroom re-fitted less than 12 months ago. We???ve been here for 8 years and enjoyed every minute of it ??? we???re sure whoever ends up there will do so too","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43446361?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Stunning one bedroom apartment with 15'3 reception and private balcony boasting spectacular views across London excellently located for Brick Lane, Spitalfields and multiple stations Leasehold","outcode":"E1","property_report_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/area-report/?listing_id=43446361&z_cmp=property%20report&z_con=get%20a%20report&z_med=propinfo%20link&z_src=ios-for-sale","image_645_430_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/9d87f0e743a295538d57cdbe68af741fc9c0b671.jpg","county":"London","price":"400000","listing_id":"43446361","image_caption":"Picture No. 04","image_80_60_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/9d87f0e743a295538d57cdbe68af741fc9c0b671_80_60.jpg","status":"for_sale","agent_name":"Robinson Jackson - Sydenham","num_recepts":"0","country":"England","first_published_date":"2017-04-05 00:59:29","displayable_address":"Spencer Way, Shadwell, London E1","price_modifier":"offers_over","floor_plan":["https://lc.zoocdn.com/b1871e4a91e37dbedc3ea6272dcd1efedbbb52d5.jpg"],"street_name":"Shadwell London","num_bathrooms":"0","agent_logo":"https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(433629).png","price_change":[{"direction":"","date":"2017-04-04 16:07:21","percent":"0%","price":"400000"}],"agent_phone":"020 3478 3507","image_354_255_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/9d87f0e743a295538d57cdbe68af741fc9c0b671.jpg","image_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/9d87f0e743a295538d57cdbe68af741fc9c0b671.jpg","last_published_date":"2017-04-07 01:18:53"},{"country_code":"gb","num_floors":"0","image_150_113_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/b433eacec8dba8e4902ccfce504e4606fb62ea87_150_113.jpg","listing_status":"sale","num_bedrooms":"3","image_50_38_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/b433eacec8dba8e4902ccfce504e4606fb62ea87_50_38.jpg","latitude":51.38746,"agent_address":"292 High Street, Orpington","category":"Residential","property_type":"Semi-detached house","longitude":0.103131,"thumbnail_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/b433eacec8dba8e4902ccfce504e4606fb62ea87_80_60.jpg","description":"An opportunity to purchase this three bedroom semi detached house.

Details of these fees are as follows:<br><br>Administration Fees (Non-optional)<br>We charge ??150 (including VAT) to cover the cost of administration of the tenancy. For clarity, this is a charge per tenancy and not per applicant.<br><br>Referencing Fees (Non-optional)<br>We use an independent referencing agency (rmt - Reference-My-Tenant) to carry out reference checks on all tenants. The cost of these checks are ??35 (including VAT) per individual joining the tenancy and ??50 (including VAT) if a company is being referenced. For clarity, each individual named in the tenancy agreement will need to pay a referencing fee. For example, 3 tenants = 3 referencing fees.<br><br>Check-In Fees (Non optional in the event that the Landlord uses the services of an Independent Inventory Clerk)<br>We use an independent inventory company (normally Ready Report) to carry out a Check-In and Check-Out service on all properties (subject to the landlord confirming that they wish to use this service). The cost of a check-in and check-out are identical and can vary from ??108 (including VAT) to ??240 (including VAT) dependent on the size of property and the amount of furnishings in the property. Most normally, tenants pay for a check-in and landlords pay for the check-out. For clarity, check in fees are payable per tenancy, not per applicant.<br><br>Early Termination (Non-optional in the event of leaving earlier than the tenancy allows)<br><br>A fundamental responsibility as a tenant is to pay your rent, but we recognize there may be circumstances whereby you need to break out of your tenancy early. If your Landlord agrees that the property can be re advertised, in order to find a suitable replacement tenant to take over your liability, you still need to continue making your regular rent payments until a new tenant takes occupation. In addition you will need to cover the Landlords fees for the unexpired term of your tenancy. These fees are calculated on a pro rata basis. Should you be thinking of leaving earlier than your tenancy agreement permits, you should contact your local branch as soon as possible for a detailed breakdown of the costs involved.<br><br>Other Fees<br><br>Currell also works on behalf of institutional, rather than private, Landlords who may have their own administration procedures and fees. This can mean that the costs vary from those detailed above. Details of these fees are available upon request, but please be assured that if these landlords charge fees then you will not be liable to pay any fees to us.","longitude":-0.083522,"thumbnail_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/e0c00903146dfe929fdc092c95e9c2e70ffbdace_80_60.jpg","description":" Key features: ???
