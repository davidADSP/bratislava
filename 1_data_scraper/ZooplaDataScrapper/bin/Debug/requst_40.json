We have experienced it to be friendly, safe and secure and a wonderful environment for bringing up children. A particular favourite are the regular street parties each year including firework and summer events.We have tried to develop on the 1930???s style house by combining a modern overall feeling but including some period features to create warmth. The kitchen is slightly cottagey. We kept divisions on the ground floor, and on other floors different ceiling heights and the archways in the original walls of the house, so that there is some definition between rooms.We created the choice of either a Master bedroom on the 1st floor, which may be the preference for parents of young children, or on the 2nd floor (a haven of quiet.... With the roll top bath).\"EPC Rating DBedroomBedroomBedroomBedroomBathroomBathroomReceptionReception","post_town":"Hampton","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43414910?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Available to view!.....This is a largely extended four double bedroom semi detached family home which is located in a popular residential road within a short walk of Hampton Train Station and Hampton Village.....","outcode":"TW12","property_report_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/area-report/?listing_id=43414910&z_cmp=property%20report&z_con=get%20a%20report&z_med=propinfo%20link&z_src=ios-for-sale","image_645_430_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/83a55b4a614c1da831f33f68fd93a50ac5904004_645_430.jpg","county":"London","price":"919950","listing_id":"43414910","image_caption":"","image_80_60_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/83a55b4a614c1da831f33f68fd93a50ac5904004_80_60.jpg","status":"for_sale","agent_name":"Chase Buchanan, Hampton Hill","num_recepts":"0","country":"England","first_published_date":"2017-03-31 22:00:30","displayable_address":"Lawrence Road, Hampton TW12","floor_plan":["https://lc.zoocdn.com/d7351ad6b88c2598443a609c1ef15c0473a6de04.jpg"],"street_name":"Lawrence Road Hampton","num_bathrooms":"0","agent_logo":"https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(308548).png","price_change":[{"direction":"","date":"2017-03-31 16:52:14","percent":"0%","price":"919950"}],"agent_phone":"020 3589 1754","image_354_255_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/83a55b4a614c1da831f33f68fd93a50ac5904004_354_255.jpg","image_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/83a55b4a614c1da831f33f68fd93a50ac5904004_354_255.jpg","last_published_date":"2017-04-04 00:50:40"},{"country_code":"gb","num_floors":"0","image_150_113_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/a82ad79f51a20013533f9dfef35855bb8f1c3f55_150_113.jpg","listing_status":"sale","num_bedrooms":"4","image_50_38_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/a82ad79f51a20013533f9dfef35855bb8f1c3f55_50_38.jpg","latitude":51.62252,"agent_address":"7th Floor, United Kingdom House, 180 Oxford Street, London","category":"Residential","property_type":"Detached house","longitude":-0.241899,"thumbnail_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/a82ad79f51a20013533f9dfef35855bb8f1c3f55_80_60.jpg","description":"An impressive detached family home in this popular turning off the Reddings in Mill Hill.This super family home has a drive way for 4 cars, lovely spacious kitchen breakfast room, two TV rooms and a bright living room.
