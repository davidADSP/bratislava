We'd come from the city and really needed a change of pace. The large rooms gave us a sense of space at all times. Walks in the park were idyllic and the local architecture stunning, not to mention the dinosaurs. We immediately got a sense of the house's uniqueness and stature as we stepped through the front door to see the light piercing through the stained glass windows. We could only think about matching it with the most brilliant of white backgrounds. We found this place in an entirely different guise but knew exactly how to modernise it. We have great memories of the many views from each different floor and passing back and forth through the entrance gates thinking how fortunate we were to live there. It was a fantastic home to live in and raise our young children. We had the space to work from home and privacy for guests. Commuting was a breeze. We shall miss our walks through the park and speaking with the local shop owners who were a real part of the community and what it stood for".These particulars, whilst believed to be accurate are set out as a general outline only for guidance and do not constitute any part of an offer or contract.
