It sits amid the Victorian grandeur of Cranfield Road - a leafy, quiet section of the street in Brockley's sought after conservation area. On this part of the street the traffic is very scarce and you will be delighted by the sounds of birds singing and the occasional church bells ringing. This flat will tick all of your search boxes - room sizes, good storage, oodles of character and a huge private garden to enjoy those summer bbq's and lazy brunches.You have the benefit of a private entrance (no more shared hallways!) located to the side of the building. You enter directly into a lobby area with a big storage cupboard located just on your left. Take a step to the right and into a smart kitchen with rich timber flooring and wooden fitted units. There are white tiled splashbacks to break things up and a run of suspended lights creates an urban, rustic feel. From here, a door leads into a fantastically spacious reception with a bay window attracting natural light and providing a pretty scope over the flower-filled front garden. The d??cor is neutral and welcoming with a fireplace to add to the charm. Continue to the rear, passing a bathroom on your right to find two bedrooms at the rear of the flat (very cleverly planned!). Both are of a good size, however the larger of the two has an enormous sash window overlooking the private garden and more tasty timber floors.The location is a corker! Find good transport links at the end of the road - Brockley station is a five minute stroll for commuter trains and the London Overground Line at Brockley for excellent services to Hoxton, Shoreditch and Clapham Junction. You'll be on the Jubilee Line at Canada Water in around 6 minutes - great for Canary Wharf or West End. Central London is also a doddle from here. Hilly Fields is your local green haven with tennis courts and far-reaching views, and Greenwich and Blackheath are both just a short drive if you fancy a Sunday adventure. Brockley's Farmers market is proving a real hit with all ages - it's on every Saturday just two minutes round the corner. Wall-to-wall street food, strong coffee to help the hangover and hipsters to inspire future fashion moves - it's well worth a visit along with Brockley's bursting local scene of gastronomic delights, local breweries, bistros and delis.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43482516?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"<p class=\"top\">Big Two Bedroom Flat with Lush Private and Shared Gardens</p><p class=\"top\">Viewings from Saturday 15th April  Taking the bottom floor of an imposing semi is this two bedroom beauty.

For this reason, this is a property that you need to view.Offered to the market for the first time in almost 40 years, its clear to see the potential of this home. The lounge is a good size with space for all the family to unwind. There is plenty of natural light pouring through too. The kitchen is a good size with ample units and worktop space. There is even room for a range cooker as well as all your recipe books! The downstairs bathroom is a welcome retreat thanks to the whirlpool bath. You could soon look forward to immersing yourself in bubbles and escaping from a stressful day. Upstairs there is room for all the family with three good size bedrooms. You may want to keep the main bedroom for yourself though as it comes complete with a fantastic range of built in wardrobes meaning all you need to worry about is the bed and unpacking your suitcase! Outside, the garden is just the place for some well earned sunshine or firing up the barbecue. There are two good size sheds both complete with power which would be a haven for anyone that likes to tinker but could also be transformed with little effort into somewhere to work from home from. To the front, there is a large driveway for parking so you can easily accommodate visitors. Well located for amenities and schools, it's also incredibly well located for both Sutton Common and West Sutton station making it a great choice for commuters too.What the Owner says:We have lived in this house for 38 years and can honestly say it has given us everything we ever needed. It's well located for all amenities with nothing ever being too far away. So much so, only one of us has ever needed to drive as we've been spoilt for convenience.Over the years we've naturally done a great deal of work to the property and if we were staying we would no doubt update and improve things further.The desire to move closer to family in South Wales though has meant we are deciding to sell and relocate out of the area and is our only motivation for moving.Room sizes:Entrance HallLounge 14'10 x 12'3 (4.52m x 3.74m)Kitchen 12'1 x 8'2 (3.69m x 2.49m)Utility CupboardBathroomLandingBedroom 1 14'2 x 12'1 (4.32m x 3.69m)Bedroom 2 11'0 x 9'1 (3.36m x 2.77m)Bedroom 3 9'9 x 8'7 (2.97m x 2.62m)DrivewayRear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

The lounge is a good size with space for all the family to unwind. There is plenty of natural light pouring through too. The kitchen is a good size with ample units and worktop space. There is even room for a range cooker as well as all your recipe books! The downstairs bathroom is a welcome retreat thanks to the whirlpool bath.

Outside, the garden is just the place for some well earned sunshine or firing up the barbecue. There are two good size sheds both complete with power which would be a haven for anyone that likes to tinker but could also be transformed with little effort into somewhere to work from home from. To the front, there is a large driveway for parking so you can easily accommodate visitors.

Approximately 10 minutesSt Pancras ??? Approximately 22 minutesCanary Wharf ??? Approximately 32 minutesHerne Hill is located on the edge of Brockwell Park, one of London's leafy expanses. Known in the past by some as \"Brixton's Beach\" Herne Hill attracts first-time buyers and young families bowled over by the property types and lifestyle on offer locally.Known for is ambiance which encourages independent shops, art galleries, bars and restaurants, Herne Hill is a great alternative to some of the more expensive towns nearby.Brockwell Park (is approximately 500 ft away from the property), with its rolling slopes, walled garden, three duck ponds and miniature railway, is best known for its large lido, now one of the few remaining outdoor swimming pools in London. Nearby, the Herne Hill Velodrome was the only remaining cycle racing track in London prior to the construction of the new Olympic venue in Stratford.Brixton which is located approximately 0.6 miles from the property is cultural mecca filled with a sense of community, which is evident for anyone who has shopped in Brixton Village or enjoyed a drink with local residents outside the Ritzy cinema. And for those in search of great entertainment, Brixton???s famous live venues, including the Brixton Academy and Hootananny are well established and reputed.Another famous adjoining town is Dulwich located approximately 0.7 miles away. Dulwich is one of the few places in London that's managed to maintain an 'old world' feel and fairytale-like village charm. A visit to Dulwich offers a foodie???s haven, some stunning properties and parks to adore as well as boutique shopping.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43480523?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"One bedroom first floor flat offering approximately 520 sq ft of living space and a private southerly facing balcony with views towards Brockwell Park.
