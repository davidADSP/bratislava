It's been a lovely space to have friends round, everyone loves the peace and scenery and sometimes neighbours have a multi garden bbq. There's very little noise, the neighbours are friendly and considerate. One of the best things is being able to cycle or walk right down to the marshes all year round and feel like you're out of the bustle. There's a nice walk via side roads and through Stoneydown Park to get to the market and pubs, and it's a friendly lively area.
