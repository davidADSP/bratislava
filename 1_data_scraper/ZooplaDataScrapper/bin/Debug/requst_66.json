Built in 1837, the house was named Rothbury in 1888 and then converted in 1936 into the current configuration of eight flats by Charles Bernard Brown, locally famous for his later conversion of The Paragon.At the end of the long private driveway, past the impressive south-facing front lawn, is parking for residents and the grand entrance on the west side of the building, glazed double doors open into the grand communal hall with beautiful tiled flooring, and imposing oak staircase. The entrance to this flat is off the top floor gallery, well lit by a two floor oriel window. The flat has a parquet floored entrance hall off which all the rooms radiate and large hatch with drop down ladder to the attic. The lovely reception room is flooded with natural light by the south and west facing windows. The attic is an enormous space, well lit by Velux windows but not conforming to current building regs as a living space.

Built in 2010, the apartment has been well maintained by the current owner and briefly comprises entrance hallway with two storage cupboards, modern fully-tiled luxury bathroom, double bedroom and open plan kitchen/living room with doors leading to a private balcony. Further benefits include oak flooring, double glazing, integrated Siemens kitchen appliances, and built-in surround sound speakers with bluetooth connectivity. This sought after private development offers 24/7 concierge, landscaped communal gardens, access to a communal roof terrace, zipcar facilities on site, and the apartment comes with secure motorcycle parking. The development is ideally located next to Maze Hill station (Southeastern) giving access to London Cannon Street in 16 mins and Greenwich station in 3 mins for transfers via DLR to Canary Wharf. Greenwich town centre, a world heritage site, is within walking distance with its historical points of interest, royal park, museums, and variety of shops, bars, and restaurants as well as river boat services to Central London. This property will appeal to discerning investors and buyers seeking a quiet city retreat and has the option of being purchased furnished. Please call to book an immediate viewing.What the vendor says: \"i've lived in Seren Park for the past six years and have loved it. I bought the flat off-plan as a first-time buyer having been captivated by the location. The development is aptly named, situated in a naturally landscaped basin with a densely wooded backdrop, it has a serene ambience that is rare in London. The transport links are also fantastic, with the City, Canary Wharf and City Airport all only 20 minutes away by train. But probably the biggest draw is the abundance of green space nearby (including Greenwich Park and Blackheath Common) and the flat's proximity to historic Greenwich. I grew up in the area and have always loved Greenwich Park, which boasts some of London's best views, best dogs, the Royal Observatory and of course the Prime Meridian line (the centre of world time). The Park is only 400 yards away from the flat, and it's a lovely walk through to Greenwich village with its famous market, excellent restaurants, Picturehouse cinema, and boutique shops. I like to stroll back from town through the Royal Naval College and breathe in the history. If you're lucky, you'll even catch the occasional period drama being filmed. In the spring, you're also only minutes away from the start of the London Marathon and in the autumn you're a stone's throw away from Blackheath's fireworks display. It's a great place to live, a place that combines the bustle of city life with the tranquillity of a village. I'll be sorry to leave, but a move overseas means it's time to sell to give someone else the chance to enjoy all it has to offer.\"","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43368486?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Franklyn James are delighted to market this chain free 2nd floor one bedroom apartment set within the Seren Park Gardens development on the doorstep of Maze Hill station close to Greenwich Park.
