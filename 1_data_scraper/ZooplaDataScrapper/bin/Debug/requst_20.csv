Another fantastic addition to our new homes in London and a unique investment opportunity in London, and the chance to invest in an area that is about to be completely transformed. Ilford is one of North East London's largest and most cosmopolitan towns, and now presents an excellent case for investment in property. Less than a five-minute walk from the future station, 'The Horizon' is a landmark new residential tower consisting of 122 studios, one bedroom and two bedroom apartments. Part of an extensive regeneration programme that will revitalise central Ilford, the striking design of Horizon will deliver a new landmark for this growing part of outer London. Horizon's striking design concept is inspired by Ilford's unique place in the history of photography and telecommunications.Effectively the capital of the Borough of Redbridge, the swathes of regeneration investment arriving in Ilford have made it one of London's key towns to watch. Driven by the coming arrival of Crossrail and the work of the Mayor's London Fund, regeneration work in the centre of Ilford is gathering pace. Ilford's Town Centre Area Action Plan includes over GBP40 million of Crossrail related investment that will see Ilford Station upgraded along with the surrounding public areas, with a focus on ease of access and urban renewal. Ilford is already a well-connected town, and offers easy access to a number of key locations across East and Central London but The GBP15.9 billion Crossrail project will transform transport in London when it opens in 2018, and Ilford will be one of the stops along the route's eastern section. Ilford station will receive a GBP11 million upgrade in preparation, and will then benefit from increased service frequency - one train every five minutes - and reduced travel times into key central London destinations.Demand for property in Ilford is being driven by population growth in the area. The Borough of Redbridge is now home to some 289,900 residents - a 16.9% increase since 2001. This growth is set to continue, with the borough's population expected to grow 22.5% to 355,000 by 2028. This population growth has supported excellent performance on the Ilford property sales market, with house prices in the borough growing by an impressive 12.8% from Q2,2014 to Q2,2015.818 Sqft (net internal)Ilford Hill, Ilford IG1;2017-04-05 09:27:38;https://li.zoocdn.com/e36487ceb9f029f20542b569a056d3d222c28aca_354_255.jpg;2017-04-07 06:21:10;51.55856;51.55856;sale;0.069524;true;2;2;0;1;IG1;Ilford;470000;;Flat;for_sale;Ilford Hill43449789;Hotspots Estate Agents;020 8115 8639;Residential;Hotspots Estates are delighted to offer this off plan, one bedroom apartment in one of London's most prestigious and exciting new residential developments Royal Mint Gardens.This apartment is located on the seventh floor of Rosemary house and has been designed to offer pure luxury with 549 SqFt of spacious living space finished to the highest specifications, bespoke custom built kitchens, indulgent bathrooms and private balcony.Royal Mint Gardens offers the perfect London river lifestyle with Tower Bridge a stone throw away.
