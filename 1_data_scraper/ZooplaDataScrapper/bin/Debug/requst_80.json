Located in the Heart of the ever popular Walthamstow village which has no through traffic and was awarded the best urban village in London by Time magazine. In recent years, the choice of restaurants in Walthamstow has multiplied, so you???ll certainly find an eatery to suit you. Perhaps best known is the Walthamstow institution Eat 17, renowned for its superb Bacon Jam. What???s great about this caf?? is that its produce is locally sourced, with meat from the East London Sausage Company and fruit and veg from Spitalfields Market. Being double bayed not only to the front but additionally to the rear gives you more space and natural light in the front reception room, two of the bedrooms as well as the kitchen/ diner. The property consists of a number of split level landings giving to access to two large reception rooms, the second which leads to the ground floor four piece bathroom suite and a spacious cellar, a kitchen/diner with double glazed doors to the rear garden finishes the ground floor. The upper floors consists of five double bedrooms and a separate w/c room. The property does require a little bit of tlc inside but has the potential to be a great family home.
