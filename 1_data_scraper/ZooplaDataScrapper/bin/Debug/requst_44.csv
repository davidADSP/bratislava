The floors have been stripped and varnished beautifully. Formal reception rooms with their original fireplaces sit off to your left with the original dividing doors offering flexibility. French windows look onto leafy street views. From the rear reception you have a deep and tall bay window onto garden views. At the rear of this floor is a sleek bathroom with tropical vista (via sash window) onto a well-established palm.On the lower ground floor you have plenty of under stairs storage plus utility room (access the garden here) and downstairs w.C. A large porch area also sits by the second front door (that???s great for bringing in groceries, wine deliveries or muddy boots). A large family room of 15ft by 11ft lies open-plan to the large kitchen of 15ft by 10ft. The fitted kitchen is nothing short of beautiful, with white gloss units and brass detail.
