Back inside on the split-level first floor there is a large bathroom with windows to the side and rear and shower over the bath; and next to that two double bedrooms, both with built-in wardrobes. Milton Grove is located moments from leafy Clissold Park and fashionable Church Street's mix of independent shops, bars and restaurants.

All three businesses are based on Ravenswood, making it the most exciting industrial estate on the planet. The Village is full of quiet residential streets that all have easy access to bucket loads of pubs and restaurants. Take in the Jazz at the Nags Head on Sunday afternoon, enjoy the excellent food and beer at the Queen???s Arms, and sample the legendary chicken and bacon jam burger at Eat17.To walk off all the food you???ve eaten, wander to the 15th century Ancient House, check out St Mary???s Church and its ivy clad church yard, have a pint in the garden at the Castle Pub, then admire the art in the windows of the old iron mongers.Dimensions:EntranceVia front door leading into:Entrance HallwayDoor To:Reception Room One (3.96m x 3.35m (13'0 x 11'0))Reception Room Two (3.45m x 2.59m (11'4 x 8'6))Kitchen/Diner (4.60m x 3.35m (15'1 x 11'0))Door To Rear Garden.First Floor LandingDoor To All First Floor Rooms.Bedroom One (4.42m x 3.35m (14'6 x 11'0))Bedroom Two (3.66m x 2.67m (12'0 x 8'9))Bedroom Three (3.35m x 2.74m (11'0 x 9'0))First Floor Bathroom (2.74m x 1.52m (9'0 x 5'0))Rear Garden (South-Facing) (approx 15.24m (approx 50'))The information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of any offer or contract, nor may it be relied upon as representations or statements of fact.
