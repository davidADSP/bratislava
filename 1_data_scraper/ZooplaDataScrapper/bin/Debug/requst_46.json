The bedrooms don???t stop here, as there is another bedroom, separate shower room and an additional loft room all on the 2nd floor.What the Owner says:We bought this house fifteen years ago, knowing that we would never run out of room and could enjoy a long stay here with our large family in a lovely road and surrounding area.The additional loft room has always come in very handy in recent years, primarily being used as a study and at times even doubled up as a guest room when we've had family come over to stay. If we were staying here for any longer we'd probably have carried out a double storey extension using the available space to the side of the house to create additional entertainment and living areas but unfortunately we are now having to relocate to be closer to a new job location.Room sizes:PorchHallwaySitting Room 10'10 x 10'2 (3.30m x 3.10m)Family Area 16'5 x 11'0 into bay (5.01m x 3.36m)Lounge Area 12'10 x 11'1 (3.91m x 3.38m)Kitchen / Dining Area (l-shaped) 17'0 x 10'0 (5.19m x 3.05m) plus 8'1 x 7'3 (2.47m x 2.21m)Conservatory 18'1 x 10'2 (5.52m x 3.10m)CloakroomLandingBedroom 1 15'7 x 9'6 into bay (4.75m x 2.90m)Bedroom 2 12'6 x 10'8 (3.81m x 3.25m)En-Suite Shower RoomBedroom 3 11'2 x 10'1 (3.41m x 3.08m)Bedroom 4 11'3 x 9'6 (3.43m x 2.90m)BathroomLandingBedroom 5 14'7 x 12'0 (4.45m x 3.66m)Loft Room / Study 10'5 x 7'3 (3.18m x 2.21m)Shower RoomOff Road ParkingRear GardenPurpose Built ShedThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

The rooms are generously sized and the high ceilings and original features give the house a lovely charm. The delightful master bedroom, cosy lounge and landscaped garden are my favourite spaces. Having two bathrooms has been a bonus, adding more flexibility and practicality to my home. There is also the opportunity to create more space by extending to do the side return and converting the loft subject to the relevant planning permission and consents. Byne Road has a fine community spirit with friendly, helpful neighbours. The location is superb too. Penge East and Sydenham stations are a short walk away with links into Victoria, London Bridge and Canada Water, and the high street has a fantastic range of shops, restaurants and amenities.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43403966?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Beautiful period family home boasting three double bedrooms, two receptions and charming original features throughout offered chain free excellently located for Sydenham and Penge East stations Freehold","outcode":"SE26","property_report_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/area-report/?listing_id=43403966&z_cmp=property%20report&z_con=get%20a%20report&z_med=propinfo%20link&z_src=ios-for-sale","image_645_430_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/d3fa399348db3c49fb19ecc39aab77e8f1f1c943_645_430.jpg","county":"London","price":"795000","listing_id":"43403966","image_caption":"Picture No. 10","image_80_60_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/d3fa399348db3c49fb19ecc39aab77e8f1f1c943_80_60.jpg","status":"for_sale","agent_name":"Robinson Jackson - Sydenham","num_recepts":"0","country":"England","first_published_date":"2017-03-31 01:04:07","displayable_address":"Byne Road, Sydenham, London SE26","price_modifier":"offers_over","floor_plan":["https://lc.zoocdn.com/9ec0b62c01c2f56a2654b47a98a30aa415f1dafc.jpg"],"street_name":"Sydenham London","num_bathrooms":"0","agent_logo":"https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(433629).png","price_change":[{"direction":"","date":"2017-03-30 16:07:22","percent":"0%","price":"795000"}],"agent_phone":"020 3478 3507","image_354_255_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/d3fa399348db3c49fb19ecc39aab77e8f1f1c943.jpg","image_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/d3fa399348db3c49fb19ecc39aab77e8f1f1c943.jpg","last_published_date":"2017-04-01 01:39:53"},{"country_code":"gb","num_floors":"0","image_150_113_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/64882d447f827987179b1a5e0b2794b8bc82ea50_150_113.jpg","listing_status":"sale","num_bedrooms":"3","image_50_38_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/64882d447f827987179b1a5e0b2794b8bc82ea50_50_38.jpg","latitude":51.471252,"agent_address":"123-125 Plumstead Common Road, Plumstead, London","category":"Residential","property_type":"Semi-detached house","longitude":0.061222,"thumbnail_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/80/60/64882d447f827987179b1a5e0b2794b8bc82ea50.jpg","description":"*** guide price ??500,000 - ??525,000 ***A three bedroom, two reception room semi detached family home located on the Shooters Hill slopes near to Oxleas woods.
