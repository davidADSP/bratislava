The bedrooms don???t stop here, as there is another bedroom, separate shower room and an additional loft room all on the 2nd floor.What the Owner says:We bought this house fifteen years ago, knowing that we would never run out of room and could enjoy a long stay here with our large family in a lovely road and surrounding area.The additional loft room has always come in very handy in recent years, primarily being used as a study and at times even doubled up as a guest room when we've had family come over to stay. If we were staying here for any longer we'd probably have carried out a double storey extension using the available space to the side of the house to create additional entertainment and living areas but unfortunately we are now having to relocate to be closer to a new job location.Room sizes:PorchHallwaySitting Room 10'10 x 10'2 (3.30m x 3.10m)Family Area 16'5 x 11'0 into bay (5.01m x 3.36m)Lounge Area 12'10 x 11'1 (3.91m x 3.38m)Kitchen / Dining Area (l-shaped) 17'0 x 10'0 (5.19m x 3.05m) plus 8'1 x 7'3 (2.47m x 2.21m)Conservatory 18'1 x 10'2 (5.52m x 3.10m)CloakroomLandingBedroom 1 15'7 x 9'6 into bay (4.75m x 2.90m)Bedroom 2 12'6 x 10'8 (3.81m x 3.25m)En-Suite Shower RoomBedroom 3 11'2 x 10'1 (3.41m x 3.08m)Bedroom 4 11'3 x 9'6 (3.43m x 2.90m)BathroomLandingBedroom 5 14'7 x 12'0 (4.45m x 3.66m)Loft Room / Study 10'5 x 7'3 (3.18m x 2.21m)Shower RoomOff Road ParkingRear GardenPurpose Built ShedThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

The bedrooms don???t stop here, as there is another bedroom, separate shower room and an additional loft room all on the 2nd floor.What the Owner says:We bought this house fifteen years ago, knowing that we would never run out of room and could enjoy a long stay here with our large family in a lovely road and surrounding area.The additional loft room has always come in very handy in recent years, primarily being used as a study and at times even doubled up as a guest room when we've had family come over to stay. If we were staying here for any longer we'd probably have carried out a double storey extension using the available space to the side of the house to create additional entertainment and living areas but unfortunately we are now having to relocate to be closer to a new job location.Room sizes:PorchHallwaySitting Room 10'10 x 10'2 (3.30m x 3.10m)Family Area 16'5 x 11'0 into bay (5.01m x 3.36m)Lounge Area 12'10 x 11'1 (3.91m x 3.38m)Kitchen / Dining Area (l-shaped) 17'0 x 10'0 (5.19m x 3.05m) plus 8'1 x 7'3 (2.47m x 2.21m)Conservatory 18'1 x 10'2 (5.52m x 3.10m)CloakroomLandingBedroom 1 15'7 x 9'6 into bay (4.75m x 2.90m)Bedroom 2 12'6 x 10'8 (3.81m x 3.25m)En-Suite Shower RoomBedroom 3 11'2 x 10'1 (3.41m x 3.08m)Bedroom 4 11'3 x 9'6 (3.43m x 2.90m)BathroomLandingBedroom 5 14'7 x 12'0 (4.45m x 3.66m)Loft Room / Study 10'5 x 7'3 (3.18m x 2.21m)Shower RoomOff Road ParkingRear GardenPurpose Built ShedThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.
