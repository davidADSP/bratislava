The open plan kitchen, bedroom and living area is cleverly designed to maximise space for both entertaining and relaxing after a long day.Fitted kitchen units are from premium designer SieMatic, in a matt finish with soft-close doors, with tough yet beautiful Corian worktops*. A full range of appliances by Siemens is included, while a separate service cupboard keeps the washer dryer and other utilities neatly out of sight. A choice of Amtico flooring* provides a touch of luxury underfoot, with underfloor heating for the ultimate in personal comfort.The master bedroom, which is carpeted, is a calm sanctuary with ample provision for storage in the fitted wardrobe. A separate shower room forms a luxurious private haven, a harmonious blend of white contemporary sanitaryware with stylish Porcelanosa tiling to the walls and floor, and a feature mosaic within the shower area.The exclusive, gated London Square Streatham Hill development benefits from a private landscaped courtyard, concierge service and residents' gym.Streatham, in south west London, is a vibrant and very popular residential neighbourhood with a lively local lifestyle. It also offers proximity to several other desirable parts of south London, each with its own contrasting attractions. These include Brixton and Clapham, laid back Balham, and genteel Dulwich, all of which offer a wide array of shops, restaurants, leisure and culture. In addition, central London is just over six miles from Streatham, putting all the delights of the capital within easy reach by road and rail.TransportLondon Victoria can be reached by train in 17 minutes* from Streatham Hill station, which is only 50 metres from London Square Streatham Hill. Streatham station is served by Thameslink, with trains running to Blackfriars, and Farringdon, while Streatham and Streatham Common stations both provide direct services to London Bridge. South Londoners also know that the bus is often a very efficient way to get from A to B. Fourteen different routes serve Streatham Hill, covering local and central London destinations.*Travel times sourced from National Rail EnquiriesLifestyleStreatham Hill is lined with shops of every description, so you'll never have far to go fordaily essentials. As well as four major supermarkets within half a mile, there's a new M&S Simply Food on the ground floor of London Square Streatham Hill, one of three new shops within the development. All will add to the animation of the high street, and bring even more quality to the area.Clapham and Brixton, both of which can be easily reached by bus or train from Streatham Hill, offer many tempting choices. In Clapham, the big stores, including Debenhams, Marks and Spencer, Boots, tk Maxx and Waterstones cluster around Clapham Junction, while Clapham Old Town is more about independent shops, such as gift and fashion boutiques. Abbeville Road and Clapham South are great for delicatessen foods, fresh meat and fish, gifts, furniture, wine and antiques.It's also worth remembering that Clapham Junction station is only four stops by London Overground from Shepherd's Bush for Westfield, the phenomenal shopping centre where luxury brands such as Gucci, Jimmy Choo and Prada can be found.Brixton's main shopping areas are around Brixton Hill and Brixton Road, where major brands like Top Shop, Benetton and New Look can be found.
