This apartment is based in the east Regency terrace built in 1824.

Inside, the rooms have great proportions, deep fireplaces and high ceilings - and all in a super convenient location too.Enter off the Grove through high railings and park in your allocated parking spot. You enter through a wide period front door into a large communal entrance area. The apartment itself has a wide entrance hall with new solid wood flooring and a good sized storage cupboard and gives you access to all the rooms. The massive reception room has all the period detail including an ornate and working fireplace, reclaimed Parquet flooring and French doors that fold back to make the garden an integral part of the home. Outside, there is a private patio area solely for this flat which leads on to a shared garden backing on to allotments and a private park, making it the ultimate in City seclusion. The patio has the sun all morning so is perfect for a nice Sunday breakfast. The galley kitchen has a smart fitted kitchen with Shaker-style units, an oak work surface and a solid wood floor. The main bedroom has built in cupboards either side of an original fireplace and a wide window to the front of the house. The second double bedroom is also a good size and has a window facing the front. The quirky, but functional, bathroom has a modern sink built into the chimney breast, marble floor, a window to the rear, a deep bath with shower over the top and underfloor heating to keep your toes toasty all year round. Also worth noting are the two big bunkers (old coal bunkers) to the front of the house that are for this flat exclusively ??? one has been used as a home office in the past and both make excellent storage solutions.Central London is easily accessible from here, the city is a 20 minute drive, Denmark Hill station (Zone 2) is a 7 minute walk for regular services to Victoria, London Bridge and Blackfriars (10 - 12 mins journey).

East Dulwich's Lordship Lane is very close and offers some of the best shops in South London including a super deli, organic butchers, boutiques and gift shops plus plenty more excellent places to eat and drink.
