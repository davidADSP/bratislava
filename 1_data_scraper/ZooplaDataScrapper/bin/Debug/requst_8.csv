That can be the only explanation when you step through the front door into this wonderful Warner flat. It really is an oasis of calm and tranquillity. But don???t think that means it???s miles from the hustle and bustle of East London. Oh no, far from it. Perfectly perched as it is on the very borders of E17 and E5, this flat is ideally situated for those who want to explore both areas. It???s even ideal for those with friends in Clapton, as the bus is literally on your doorstep (which is handy for the commute into work as well). So either peace and tranquillity inside the flat, or the delights of Walthamstow, Leyton and Hackney when you are out. Either way, this flat is perfect for all.Living Here...Walk through the front door of this delightful home and the first room you will encounter off the long hallway is the spacious lounge, which is flooded with light from the three sash windows. Further along you will discover the first of the two double bedrooms followed by a contemporary kitchen that also provides access to the garden. Back inside the flat next is an immaculate family bathroom, and lastly the final double bedroom at the rear of the flat is flooded with light from the south facing garden. Outside the garden is a great place for entertaining guests in the coming summer months, or just a hot bbq and ice cold beer (maybe from Clapton Craft) with closer ties.In This Area - By Walthamstow DiaryGet off the tube at Walthamstow Central and find the world waiting for you. Honestly, this is no exaggeration, if you want something, you???ll likely find it not too far from the station. The market, the longest in Europe, is busy and thriving. Pick up fresh fruit and veg, or visit the rotisserie stall on a Saturday for the best pork or chicken baguettes in town. Next to the market we have a shopping centre packed with high street names, and right at the top of the High Street you???ll find our new cinema and retail complex. Called the Scene, it is home to a ten screen Empire cinema, Pizza Express, and loads of other bars and restaurants. Just around the corner from this new cinema, is a very old one. The Granada opened in 1930, and after a long campaign by local residents it has recently reopened as a bar and live music venue. Now called Mirth, Marvel and Maud, this building is simply stunning. The hustle and bustle of the High Street is contrasted by the quiet residential streets that surround it. This part of Walthamstow really gives you the best of both worlds, a shopping hub, nightlife, and peace and quiet at home.Dimensions:EntranceVia front door leading into:Entrance Hallway (6.68m x 1.83m (21'11 x 6'0))Reception Room (3.38m x 3.18m (11'1 x 10'5))Kitchen (2.59m x 2.39m (8'6 x 7'10))Access To Rear Garden.Bedroom One (3.53m x 3.48m (11'7 x 11'5))Bedroom Two (3.38m x 3.20m (11'1 x 10'6))Bathroom (2.59m x 2.46m (8'6 x 8'1))Rear Garden (Shared South-Facing) (approx 9.14m (approx 30'))The information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of any offer or contract, nor may it be relied upon as representations or statements of fact.
