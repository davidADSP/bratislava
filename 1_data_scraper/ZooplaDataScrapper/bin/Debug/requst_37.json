However, you may be finding that there is a lack of properties available that combine the space you need and the location you desire. This delightful home can certainly ticks these boxes???Having been lovingly cared for throughout the years by the current owners, this house still has the scope to update to your own taste.On the ground floor the lounge/diner is simply the perfect backdrop for an evening relaxing in front of the television after a hard day at work. With double doors leading out onto your beautiful low maintenance garden, open up the doors and let the sunshine flood in on those warm summer evenings.The kitchen offers an exceptional amount of both worktop space and storage ??? meaning rustling up those evening meals will no longer seem a chore. You also have the luxury of a sizable utility room ??? this really is perfect for a busy family home.Upstairs, this home certainly continues to impress with three spacious bedrooms ??? two of which can comfortably fit double beds and more!Being just a stones throw away from the coveted Cheam Park Farm area of North Cheam, as well as being close to convenient transport links and the town centre ??? what other reasons do you need to book your appointment to come and view?What the Owner says:We have lived in our home since it was brand new 49 years ago and it has been a wonderful place to raise our family. Our children are now grown up with their own homes, but it was so convenient being able to walk to Cheam Park Farm Primary on the school run. Not only that, but having the park over the road was a god send in the school holidays!As well as the location, it was the space that initially brought us here ??? having the third bedroom and the private garden was something we were struggling to find elsewhere. It is time for us to downsize as we no longer need so many bedrooms, and could do without the stairs but we will miss this house very much ??? we wish the new owners lots of happy memories here.Room sizes:Lounge/Diner 21'8 x 11'9 (6.61m x 3.58m)Kitchen 12'3 x 7'6 (3.74m x 2.29m)Utility Room 9'4 x 5'8 (2.85m x 1.73m)Bedroom 1 12'2 x 10'6 (3.71m x 3.20m)Bedroom 2 10'5 x 10'0 (3.18m x 3.05m)Bedroom 3 12'3 x 5'10 (3.74m x 1.78m)Separate Toilet 6'9 x 2'8 (2.06m x 0.81m)Bathroom 6'7 x 4'7 (2.01m x 1.40m)Front GardenRear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

However, you may be finding that there is a lack of properties available that combine the space you need and the location you desire. This delightful home can certainly ticks these boxes???Having been lovingly cared for throughout the years by the current owners, this house still has the scope to update to your own taste.On the ground floor the lounge/diner is simply the perfect backdrop for an evening relaxing in front of the television after a hard day at work. With double doors leading out onto your beautiful low maintenance garden, open up the doors and let the sunshine flood in on those warm summer evenings.The kitchen offers an exceptional amount of both worktop space and storage ??? meaning rustling up those evening meals will no longer seem a chore. You also have the luxury of a sizable utility room ??? this really is perfect for a busy family home.Upstairs, this home certainly continues to impress with three spacious bedrooms ??? two of which can comfortably fit double beds and more!Being just a stones throw away from the coveted Cheam Park Farm area of North Cheam, as well as being close to convenient transport links and the town centre ??? what other reasons do you need to book your appointment to come and view?What the Owner says:We have lived in our home since it was brand new 49 years ago and it has been a wonderful place to raise our family. Our children are now grown up with their own homes, but it was so convenient being able to walk to Cheam Park Farm Primary on the school run. Not only that, but having the park over the road was a god send in the school holidays!As well as the location, it was the space that initially brought us here ??? having the third bedroom and the private garden was something we were struggling to find elsewhere. It is time for us to downsize as we no longer need so many bedrooms, and could do without the stairs but we will miss this house very much ??? we wish the new owners lots of happy memories here.Room sizes:Lounge/Diner 21'8 x 11'9 (6.61m x 3.58m)Kitchen 12'3 x 7'6 (3.74m x 2.29m)Utility Room 9'4 x 5'8 (2.85m x 1.73m)Bedroom 1 12'2 x 10'6 (3.71m x 3.20m)Bedroom 2 10'5 x 10'0 (3.18m x 3.05m)Bedroom 3 12'3 x 5'10 (3.74m x 1.78m)Separate Toilet 6'9 x 2'8 (2.06m x 0.81m)Bathroom 6'7 x 4'7 (2.01m x 1.40m)Front GardenRear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.
