Before Crossrails completion in 2018 the nearby Jubilee Line and Docklands Light Railway at Canning Town Station (only a two minute walk away) provide a number of efficient travel options. Feeding into the Underground and Overground networks, access to St Pancras and continental Europe is extremely swift. Liverpool Street and the West End both take under 20 minutes by train and with City Airport a mere seven minutes away at the Royal Albert Docks, you'll waste no more time sat waiting in the departures lounge for flights to New York and beyond. For trips a little closer to home, it takes seven minutes to travel between Stratford and Canning Town on the underground. Home to the Stratford Westfield shopping centre the area is also a major transport hub, ensuring access across the city is quick and easy.These particulars are not intended to, and do not offer or form part of any contract and whilst these sales particulars are believed to be correct, their accuracy is in no way guaranteed.
