With spacious accommodation situated over three floors this stunning home boasts incredible living space for all the family. The kitchen/dining area is ideal for family get-togethers and with the impressive adjoining family area you could find yourself spending most of your time out here! The kitchen itself is stunning and wonderfully stylish with granite work tops and superb appliances. On those warmer days you can throw open the doors onto the garden from here. The separate lounge is a superb size with lots of room for relaxing as a family in front of the feature fire. When you find yourself with a house full, you can put everyone up with ease thanks to six brilliant bedrooms spread over the first and second floor. In addition there is a luxury bathroom on every level including the ground floor. There should be no fighting over who gets which room in this house! Outside you can soak up some sunshine on the patio as the kids tire themselves out on the lawn and the additional summer house/studio would make a great office or den. There is also the added advantage of the driveway at the front. Well located for the town, exceptional schools and the train station this exceptional, quality home has it all.What the Owner says:We bought this house 10 years ago and for us it was all about the location! We knew it was a great area - quiet and peaceful yet so close by to the local school, excellent transport links and shops.When we stepped inside we were blown away by the potential it offered. Over the years we have completely transformed it with everything having been done. We have extended both outwards and upwards and created a very spacious home in doing so. This was important to us as with four children, it was imperative that we had enough space for everyone. We also installed a new kitchen and replaced all three bathrooms as well as adding the plantation shutters and redecorating throughout. We have finished everything to the highest specification and have achieved our dream to create a lovely family home.Room sizes:Entrance HallLounge 15'3 x 13'6 (4.65m x 4.12m)Shower RoomUtility Area 13'9 x 9'5 (4.19m x 2.87m)Family Area 15'2 x 11'3 (4.63m x 3.43m)Kitchen/Dining Area 19'2 x 10'5 (5.85m x 3.18m)LandingBedroom 2 15'2 x 11'3 (4.63m x 3.43m)Bedroom 3 13'3 x 9'5 (4.04m x 2.87m)BathroomBedroom 1 14'1 x 13'8 (4.30m x 4.17m)Bedroom 6 12'2 x 6'10 (3.71m x 2.08m)Loft Space 13'5 x 11'7 (4.09m x 3.53m)Shower RoomBedroom 5 12'7 x 10'3 (3.84m x 3.13m)Bedroom 4 12'8 x 10'2 (3.86m x 3.10m)DrivewayFront GardenRear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.
