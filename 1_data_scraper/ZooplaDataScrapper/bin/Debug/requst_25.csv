We were stunned when we first viewed the place in 2006 and realised that not only was it a lovely spacious 1st floor flat but it had stairs at the back going down to it's own garden! We pretty much immediately decided to take the plunge and we haven't looked back. The flat has always felt comfortable and friendly. The street is really quiet especially at night and we like looking out of the living room window at the tree in front and the night sky which usually features a bright moon looking back. We've enjoyed seeing Sydenham change over the years including getting the overground. The great transport links are a blessing here and have really helped facilitate our lives.
