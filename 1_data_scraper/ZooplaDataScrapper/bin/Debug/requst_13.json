On the other side of Lea Bridge Road you???ll find the King William IV pub, which is also home to Brodies Brewery. If you like beer, pay a visit to their annual Easter event, the Bunny Basher, though you might want to pre-warn your liver. Further up Hoe Street is the incredible Hornbeam Caf??, a great spot to enjoy fresh, locally produced food. The Hornbeam also host live music and film nights. This end of Hoe Street links Walthamstow to Leyton and has good transport links. There???s a good mix of properties here, and if you like to keep fit, this is the place for you. Leyton Gym and Leisure lagoon (complete with water slides) is just around the corner.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Dimensions:</strong></h3><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Entrance</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Via front door leading into:</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Entrance Porch</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Further door leading into:</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Entrance Hallway</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Staircase leading to first floor.

This sale represents a truly rare opportunity to buy one of these landmark houses that boasts incredible lateral space, width of plot and an alternative to the more common Victorian/ Edwardian architecture. The current owners have gone to great lengths to retain many of the original features, which will appeal to anyone with an interest in design and architecture.One of the most striking features as you enter the property, is the shear width of plot that measures in excess of 44ft across. To put this into context, the plot could easily accommodate two fairly significant Victorian houses, side by side.The sense of space is evident as soon as you walk through the front door to the stunning entrance hall, with its original panelling and open tread staircase. No less than four reception rooms lead from the entrance hall, one of which is open plan to the kitchen. There is direct access from two of the ground floor rooms to a superb south facing garden that measures in excess of 100 feet in length.Another feature that gives this house unique status is its pair of garages, that are situated at the end of the garden and accessed via Burntwood Grange. The opportunities for these garages are endless, from their original purpose as secure parking through to conversion to an annex, studio or playroom (subject to the usual consents).A spacious master bedroom can be found to the rear of the first floor with a luxurious en-suite bathroom and south facing balcony. Three further bedrooms and a family bathroom can also be found on the same level. The second-floor boasts two further good bedrooms, a shower room and a roof terrace. The roof terrace benefits from impressive far reaching views of the southwest London skyline and offers an excellent space for entertaining.There is plenty of scope for further development, if more space is required. The property also has off-street parking to the front, a landscaped front garden and side access.Herondale Avenue runs from Lyford Road to Ellerton Road. Wandsworth Common is at the eastern end of the road, so the amenities of Bellevue Road are within easy walking distance. Transport can be found at Wandsworth Common overground with its links into Victoria. The area is well known for its abundance of good state and private schools, subject to catchment and entrance each year.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43466752?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"This incredible house is one of only six houses built in the Bauhaus style, situated on Herondale Avenue, one of Wandsworth's premier residential streets.

It is a rare event that seldom happens - but we are now able to offer you that opportunity.This home is unlike any other we currently have on the market, so having to compromise is no longer the issue.Inside, this gorgeous two bedroom split level apartment is offered to an unsurpassed level, the fantastic open plan lounge area will really impress your friends and family. It is surely a feature of the property, with so much space to relax in.The rest of the property does not disappoint with a spacious modern kitchen area to cook your favourite meals for your guests. As an extra bonus there is not just a family bathroom but also an en ??? suite off of the master bedroom. So no need to be late in the morning's anymore! Now this is where the property really excels ??? the master bedroom is quite possibly the largest bedroom we have ever seen in any apartment.On the outside, the location really doesn't get any better. Ever fancied a leafy but quiet South Sutton road? This home ticks that box and is also close by to Sutton's local amenities - making life that little bit easier we are sure!So where are the downsides? Well if you consider that there is also an allocated parking space, we are struggling to find one!What the Owner says:When we were looking for an apartment we were really keen to find a place with a wow factor. It seemed that we would not be able to find such a place until we visited Fairwyns Court!We were blown away by the size of the property especially the master bedroom which is absolutely huge.The location has been an excellent one for us as we are able to walk into town very easily. We have now decided to move on to a different location, we hope the new owners are as happy here as we have been.Room sizes:Entrance HallBathroom 7'7 x 5'1 (2.31m x 1.55m)Bedroom 2 12'2 x 9'10 (3.71m x 3.00m)Lounge AreaKitchen Area 9'7 x 9'6 (2.92m x 2.90m)Bedroom 1 21'6 x 18'11 (6.56m x 5.77m)En - Suite 8'0 x 5'3 (2.44m x 1.60m)Allocated ParkingThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

You may be experiencing major problems in finding that there is just nothing on the market that meets your high standards. Now this is where we are going to make your day, nestled in a coveted residential location you will find this spacious house, sitting pride of place in a convenient road.Inside, the property has kept a lot of the original features and offers excellent proportions with wonderful features such as the bay window and a log burner, creating an ideal place to snuggle up with a good book in the colder months. A separate dining area waits for you towards the back of the property - excellent for when you entertain at one of your dinner parties!Furthermore, this house is certainly an excellent size for the period of build with fantastic space, like the well-proportioned kitchen area and a further room which is currently used as a playroom.On the first floor this house doesn't let you down with spacious dimensions throughout all the bedrooms and the bathroom being a modern space you will love relaxing in at the end of the day.So you have looked at other four bedroom houses but what are they missing? Somewhere to park! So what you have here is a driveway to leave the car on and walk into town. To top everything off the property is superbly located with schools, great amenities and a train station all only a short walk away.What the Owner says:We bought this house 13 years ago as we completely fell in love with the size of it. The minute we walked through the door, we were bowled over by the large rooms and high ceilings. It was and is an excellent location for schools and having 2 boys, this was important to us. They both went to the Avenue which is an incredibly sought after school. The location is also ideal for the town centre and the station is very easy for commuting especially as we have a driveway so can leave the car at home. Since living here, we have replaced the central heating system and had the windows replaced. We also re-decorated throughout. It's an amazing home for any family and I will certainly miss the convenience of living here.Room sizes:Entrance HallLounge 14'3 x 12'9 (4.35m x 3.89m)Dining Area 11'5 x 10'7 (3.48m x 3.23m)Kitchen Area 8'8 x 8'7 (2.64m x 2.62m)Play room 18'0 x 11'10 (5.49m x 3.61m)LandingBathroom 8'11 x 8'0 (2.72m x 2.44m)Bedroom 1 14'3 x 12'0 (4.35m x 3.66m)Bedroom 3 10'7 x 10'0 (3.23m x 3.05m)Bedroom 2 15'7 x 11'6 (4.75m x 3.51m)Bedroom 4 8'1 x 6'5 (2.47m x 1.96m)Separate ToiletDrivewayRear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

That painful task could now be over as this superb home is a show stopper for all of the above!Your commute to work couldn???t be simpler living here, being so centrally located in Wallington, a brisk walk to the station in the morning could take you less than ten minutes, being just .4 of a mile away - imagine the extra time you could have hitting the snooze button!Often your lifestyle in a flat is dictated by the space you have and if you have enough room then inviting friends over for dinner is something you like to do, then the great news is that there's plenty of room here! The lounge is spacious enough to hold a dinner party in if you so desired.

You may be experiencing major problems in finding that there is just nothing on the market that meets your high standards. Now this is where we are going to make your day, nestled in a coveted residential location you will find this spacious house, sitting pride of place in a convenient road.Inside, the property has kept a lot of the original features and offers excellent proportions with wonderful features such as the bay window and a log burner, creating an ideal place to snuggle up with a good book in the colder months. A separate dining area waits for you towards the back of the property - excellent for when you entertain at one of your dinner parties!Furthermore, this house is certainly an excellent size for the period of build with fantastic space, like the well-proportioned kitchen area and a further room which is currently used as a playroom.On the first floor this house doesn't let you down with spacious dimensions throughout all the bedrooms and the bathroom being a modern space you will love relaxing in at the end of the day.So you have looked at other four bedroom houses but what are they missing? Somewhere to park! So what you have here is a driveway to leave the car on and walk into town. To top everything off the property is superbly located with schools, great amenities and a train station all only a short walk away.What the Owner says:We bought this house 13 years ago as we completely fell in love with the size of it. The minute we walked through the door, we were bowled over by the large rooms and high ceilings. It was and is an excellent location for schools and having 2 boys, this was important to us. They both went to the Avenue which is an incredibly sought after school. The location is also ideal for the town centre and the station is very easy for commuting especially as we have a driveway so can leave the car at home. Since living here, we have replaced the central heating system and had the windows replaced. We also re-decorated throughout. It's an amazing home for any family and I will certainly miss the convenience of living here.Room sizes:Entrance HallLounge 14'3 x 12'9 (4.35m x 3.89m)Dining Area 11'5 x 10'7 (3.48m x 3.23m)Kitchen Area 8'8 x 8'7 (2.64m x 2.62m)Play room 18'0 x 11'10 (5.49m x 3.61m)LandingBathroom 8'11 x 8'0 (2.72m x 2.44m)Bedroom 1 14'3 x 12'0 (4.35m x 3.66m)Bedroom 3 10'7 x 10'0 (3.23m x 3.05m)Bedroom 2 15'7 x 11'6 (4.75m x 3.51m)Bedroom 4 8'1 x 6'5 (2.47m x 1.96m)Separate ToiletDrivewayRear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

It is a rare event that seldom happens - but we are now able to offer you that opportunity.This home is unlike any other we currently have on the market, so having to compromise is no longer the issue.Inside, this gorgeous two bedroom split level apartment is offered to an unsurpassed level, the fantastic open plan lounge area will really impress your friends and family. It is surely a feature of the property, with so much space to relax in.The rest of the property does not disappoint with a spacious modern kitchen area to cook your favourite meals for your guests. As an extra bonus there is not just a family bathroom but also an en ??? suite off of the master bedroom. So no need to be late in the morning's anymore! Now this is where the property really excels ??? the master bedroom is quite possibly the largest bedroom we have ever seen in any apartment.On the outside, the location really doesn't get any better. Ever fancied a leafy but quiet South Sutton road? This home ticks that box and is also close by to Sutton's local amenities - making life that little bit easier we are sure!So where are the downsides? Well if you consider that there is also an allocated parking space, we are struggling to find one!What the Owner says:When we were looking for an apartment we were really keen to find a place with a wow factor. It seemed that we would not be able to find such a place until we visited Fairwyns Court!We were blown away by the size of the property especially the master bedroom which is absolutely huge.The location has been an excellent one for us as we are able to walk into town very easily.
