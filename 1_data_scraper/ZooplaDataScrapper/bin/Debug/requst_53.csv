Built on what was once the extensive grounds of 'The Manor House' now the 'North Middlesex Golf Club' which included 29 acres of land between, Friern Barnet Lane and Oakleigh Road North. In 1929 the first roads to be built were Church Crescent and Church Way, creating The Church Farm Estate. The plot remained vacant until 1953, when the land changed hands and this particular 'one off' property was built. In keeping with the period the property retains much of its original features. There is a central hallway, with steps down to a guest toilet. The main reception room is 'L' shaped with a recess dining area, 'open plan' design, with a double aspect sitting room with doors to the paved patio. The kitchen has a separate breakfast area and a door to the side entrance. The first floor has low slung eaves and a semi-galleried landing with doors off to all rooms. There are two double bedrooms with a bathroom between them, both being dual aspect. This is a considerably good sized plot with a rear garden in excess of 100ft and a frontage of approximately 40ft.
