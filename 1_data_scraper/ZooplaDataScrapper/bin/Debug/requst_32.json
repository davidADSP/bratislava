This is the perfect starter home and it is located close to good schools, recreational parks and convenience shopping.When you step through the door you just need to stand there for a moment and visualise how it will look with your furniture, your colours on the walls and your personal possessions dotted here and there throughout the flat. As a large space you can adapt it to suit your needs.Imagine on a sunny afternoon with your garden table creaking under the weight of the feast that you have prepared and your guests enjoying your culinary delights and partaking in animated conversation. When everyone has departed what could be more relaxing than submerging yourself in a bath full of bubbles before crawling into bed and surrounding yourself with the warmth of your quilt. It may sound like a dream but this really could be your reality.Take that first step and embark on your property journey. See how this property can be transformed into your dream home.What the Owner says:This property has been a wonderful investment for me. Being on the ground floor it has been convenient for any guests who have come with their baby and buggy. On warm days the baby, buggy and ourselves have enjoyed the serenity of the private garden. The large proportions of the property has also meant that those bigger items of furniture can easily be accommodated.This is the perfect flat for a young family starting out, for an investor looking for a good rental property or as a home for when the children have flown the nest and your large four bedroom house is now too quiet. It is now time for me to hand the keys over to someone who will appreciate this as much as I have.Room sizes:Ground floorHallwayLounge/Diner 14'0 x 13'2 (4.27m x 4.02m)Kitchen 10'6 x 10'0 (3.20m x 3.05m)Bedroom 1 13'11 x 10'2 (4.24m x 3.10m)Bedroom 2 13'2 x 9'0 (4.02m x 2.75m)BathroomOutsideRear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

Perched just off Lea Bridge Road, the bus ride into the City couldn???t be easier, plus there is the added bonus of the newly re-opened Lea Bridge Station. But all work and no play is not a recipe for happiness. Fortunately, the location of this house scores highly there as well. Something to eat? Jump on the bus to Chatsworth Road, or head in the other direction to Leyton High Road ??? plenty of choice on offer for even the most fickle foodies amongst you. Fancy some exercise? Head up to the ice rink for a leisurely skate, or perhaps head to the equestrian centre if four legs seem better than two blades. If that sounds too active, you could settle for a stroll around Leyton Manor Park ??? it???s literally on your doorstep.Living Here...We think this is a lovely house, and we are pretty sure you will too. The dual aspect lounge diner is the perfect place for entertaining family and friends, whilst the wide galley kitchen offers plenty of space in which to hone your culinary skills. Follow the beautiful stripped wood flooring upwards and on the first floor you will discover three bedrooms and the family bathroom, whilst the loft offers scope to add further space, subject of course to obtaining the usual permissions. The icing on this property cake is the private rear garden ??? the perfect spot to relax with a cup of tea at the end of a hard day.In This Area - By Walthamstow DiaryLeyton is home to the only shop that can be seen from space. Ok, that's not entirely true, but the carnival shop on the high road is definitely bright. There's no way you'll miss this multi coloured wonder, it looks like it's made of Lego. The shop sits opposite coronation gardens, a beautiful park with a little maze, pond and fountain. Walk all the way through Coronation Gardens and you'll find Leyton beach, yep, that's right, Leyton beach, former training ground for beach volley ball teams during the 2012 Olympics. The high road is also home to the Leyton technical, a lovely pub that occupies the ground floor of the old town hall. It has good beer, good food, and the longest walk to the toilet you'll ever find. If you like beer, Leyton is the place for you, as both Brodie's beers and the East London Brewing Company are based in E10. Sidmouth Park, just behind the carnival shop, is a hit with kids as there's loads of stuff to play on. If you are hungry or thirsty, wander to Francis road and you'll find a bucket load of nice cafes, including Yardarm, Marmelo Kitchen, and Albert & Francis.EntranceVia front door leading into:Entrnace HallwayOpen To:Lounge/Diner (7.47m x 4.29m (24'6 x 14'1))Staircase leading to first floor.

This superb three bedroom terraced house, which has been renovated to a high standard, is ideally located for those who want to make their daily commute as pain free as possible. Perched just off Lea Bridge Road, the bus ride into the City couldn???t be easier, plus there is the added bonus of the newly re-opened Lea Bridge Station. But all work and no play is not a recipe for happiness. Fortunately, the location of this house scores highly there as well. Something to eat? Jump on the bus to Chatsworth Road, or head in the other direction to Leyton High Road ??? plenty of choice on offer for even the most fickle foodies amongst you. Fancy some exercise? Head up to the ice rink for a leisurely skate, or perhaps head to the equestrian centre if four legs seem better than two blades. If that sounds too active, you could settle for a stroll around Leyton Manor Park ??? it???s literally on your doorstep.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Living Here...</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">We think this is a lovely house, and we are pretty sure you will too. The dual aspect lounge diner is the perfect place for entertaining family and friends, whilst the wide galley kitchen offers plenty of space in which to hone your culinary skills. Follow the beautiful stripped wood flooring upwards and on the first floor you will discover three bedrooms and the family bathroom, whilst the loft offers scope to add further space, subject of course to obtaining the usual permissions. The icing on this property cake is the private rear garden ??? the perfect spot to relax with a cup of tea at the end of a hard day.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>In This Area - By Walthamstow Diary</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Leyton is home to the only shop that can be seen from space. Ok, that's not entirely true, but the carnival shop on the high road is definitely bright. There's no way you'll miss this multi coloured wonder, it looks like it's made of Lego. The shop sits opposite coronation gardens, a beautiful park with a little maze, pond and fountain. Walk all the way through Coronation Gardens and you'll find Leyton beach, yep, that's right, Leyton beach, former training ground for beach volley ball teams during the 2012 Olympics. The high road is also home to the Leyton technical, a lovely pub that occupies the ground floor of the old town hall. It has good beer, good food, and the longest walk to the toilet you'll ever find. If you like beer, Leyton is the place for you, as both Brodie's beers and the East London Brewing Company are based in E10. Sidmouth Park, just behind the carnival shop, is a hit with kids as there's loads of stuff to play on. If you are hungry or thirsty, wander to Francis road and you'll find a bucket load of nice cafes, including Yardarm, Marmelo Kitchen, and Albert &amp; Francis.</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Entrance</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Via front door leading into:</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Entrnace Hallway</strong></h3><p class=\"top\">Open To:</p><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Lounge/Diner</strong> (7.47m x 4.29m (24'6 x 14'1))</h3><p class=\"top\">Staircase leading to first floor.
