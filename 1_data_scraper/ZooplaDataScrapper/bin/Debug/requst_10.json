So, what's in store? Enter the apartment and the tone is immediately set by the volume of natural light flooding the entrance hall. As tease, if you will, of what awaits in the main living space. It's simply gorgeous, with wall to wall daylight, uber-cool decor complimented by the warmth of natural wood flooring. It's open plan so you can show off that sumptuous kitchen: High end Miele appliances, and the funkiest dishwasher ever, a Fisher & Paykel 2 drawer affair that will have your dinner guests offering to clear up the second the coffee is finished.All of this, however, is just warming us up for the finale: The winter garden. Swoosh those sliding doors open and, well, wowzers. Jaw-dropping, heart pounding panoramic views of the Thames stretching from Putney to Wandsworth, and just wait for that sunset. Want to see more? Excellent, let's move on to the master bedroom suite. An abundance of calmness, with his (single) and hers (double) closets, and a beautiful, contemporary en suite bathroom. Next up is bedroom two, perfect for guests or little ones, again with built in closet, and right next door to the main bathroom. Underfloor heating throughout keeps things toasty, and there's a comfort cooling system for those balmy Summer days. Are we done? Not by a long way: It comes with a secured underground parking spot and a storage cage. The lease, at 999 years, is a virtual Freehold. You have exclusive, residents only on site leisure facilities including a fully fitted gym, a pool for those early morning swims, jacuzzi and sauna.Riverside Quarter is well planned, and has lush gardens between the apartment buildings, now maturing nicely, and there are businesses occupying the ground floors that add a buzz to proceedings.There's no problem getting into the office, with a River bus pier on site, and a commuting times shuttle bus whizzing you to Putney & East Putney stations.Wandsworth is close to two major shopping centres, and just across the river is Chelsea and Fulham's famous Hurlingham Club. There's world class eateries and bars nearby, and green space is provided by Wandsworth Park, a few minutes away.The A3 give easy access to the South and South West for those weekends away.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43472568?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"7th Floor I 2 Bedrooms I River Views I Winter Garden I 2 Bathrooms I 98sqm/1055sqf I Underfloor Heating I Comfort Cooling I 24hr Concierge I Underground Parking &amp; Storage I Gym/Pool/Sauna I River Bus Pier I Residents Shuttle Bus I 999 Year Lease I","outcode":"SW18","property_report_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/area-report/?listing_id=43472568&z_cmp=property%20report&z_con=get%20a%20report&z_med=propinfo%20link&z_src=ios-for-sale","image_645_430_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/8db38646ad3568ee44d4227c3ef49a5672379b3d.jpg","county":"London","price":"1050000","listing_id":"43472568","image_caption":"External","image_80_60_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/80/60/8db38646ad3568ee44d4227c3ef49a5672379b3d.jpg","status":"for_sale","agent_name":"Warren Kerr","num_recepts":"1","country":"England","first_published_date":"2017-04-06 15:33:28","displayable_address":"3 Eastfields Ave, Wandsworth SW18","price_modifier":"guide_price","floor_plan":["https://lc.zoocdn.com/127237a8f23876c686931151b0e0b66dcc0e3582.png"],"street_name":"3 Eastfields Ave","num_bathrooms":"2","agent_logo":"https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(300427).png","price_change":[{"direction":"","date":"2017-04-06 15:33:06","percent":"0%","price":"1050000"}],"agent_phone":"020 8022 4980","image_354_255_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/8db38646ad3568ee44d4227c3ef49a5672379b3d.jpg","image_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/8db38646ad3568ee44d4227c3ef49a5672379b3d.jpg","last_published_date":"2017-04-07 01:49:07"},{"country_code":"gb","num_floors":"0","image_150_113_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/150/113/31fcb131ae0e4aa665680a419a557a45382f1fce.jpg","listing_status":"sale","num_bedrooms":"2","image_50_38_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/31fcb131ae0e4aa665680a419a557a45382f1fce_50_38.jpg","latitude":51.469383,"agent_address":"174A Lavender Hill, Battersea","category":"Residential","property_type":"Mews house","letting_fees":"Administration Fee ??180 inc Vat per person.<br><br>Guarantor Administration Fee ??60 inc Vat per guarantor<br><br>Inventory Check price variable *dependent* on the size of the property.<br><br>Renewal Charge ??90 inc Vat<br><br>Change of Occupant ??480 inc Vat for one replacement tenant<br><br>Holding Deposit, unless advised otherwise ??250 per person, minimum ??500.","longitude":-0.158265,"thumbnail_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/31fcb131ae0e4aa665680a419a557a45382f1fce_80_60.jpg","description":"This stylish and well presented two bedroom terraced house is located on a quiet residential street within the popular Shaftsbury Estate and is perfectly placed equidistant between Battersea Park and Clapham Common.
