I bought the flat off-plan as a first-time buyer having been captivated by the location. The development is aptly named, situated in a naturally landscaped basin with a densely wooded backdrop, it has a serene ambience that is rare in London. The transport links are also fantastic, with the City, Canary Wharf and City Airport all only 20 minutes away by train. But probably the biggest draw is the abundance of green space nearby (including Greenwich Park and Blackheath Common) and the flat's proximity to historic Greenwich. I grew up in the area and have always loved Greenwich Park, which boasts some of London's best views, best dogs, the Royal Observatory and of course the Prime Meridian line (the centre of world time). The Park is only 400 yards away from the flat, and it's a lovely walk through to Greenwich village with its famous market, excellent restaurants, Picturehouse cinema, and boutique shops. I like to stroll back from town through the Royal Naval College and breathe in the history. If you're lucky, you'll even catch the occasional period drama being filmed. In the spring, you're also only minutes away from the start of the London Marathon and in the autumn you're a stone's throw away from Blackheath's fireworks display. It's a great place to live, a place that combines the bustle of city life with the tranquillity of a village. I'll be sorry to leave, but a move overseas means it's time to sell to give someone else the chance to enjoy all it has to offer."Seren Park Gardens, Blackheath SE3;2017-03-28 07:49:44;https://li.zoocdn.com/cd11eff681700abdb39562aa9b1ef659184ca730_354_255.jpg;2017-03-29 06:01:12;51.48217;51.48217;sale;0.005285;false;1;1;0;1;SE3;London;375000;;Flat;for_sale;Seren Park Gardens Greenwich43368432;Inner City Estates;020 8128 0666;Residential;Two bedroom, two bathroom apartment in the highly sought after Bow Connection development.The property has a large open plan living area with a Juliette balcony.
