We have experienced it to be friendly, safe and secure and a wonderful environment for bringing up children. A particular favourite are the regular street parties each year including firework and summer events.We have tried to develop on the 1930???s style house by combining a modern overall feeling but including some period features to create warmth. The kitchen is slightly cottagey. We kept divisions on the ground floor, and on other floors different ceiling heights and the archways in the original walls of the house, so that there is some definition between rooms.We created the choice of either a Master bedroom on the 1st floor, which may be the preference for parents of young children, or on the 2nd floor (a haven of quiet....
