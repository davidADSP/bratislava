Details of these fees are as follows:<br><br>Administration Fees (Non-optional)<br>We charge ??240 (including VAT) to cover the cost of administration of the tenancy. For clarity, this is a charge per tenancy and not per applicant.<br><br>Referencing Fees (Non-optional)<br>We use an independent referencing agency (rmt - Reference-My-Tenant) to carry out reference checks on all tenants. The cost of these checks are ??40 (including VAT) per individual joining the tenancy and ??50 (including VAT) if a company is being referenced. For clarity, each individual named in the tenancy agreement will need to pay a referencing fee. For example, 3 tenants = 3 referencing fees.<br><br>Check-In Fees (Non optional in the event that the Landlord uses the services of an Independent Inventory Clerk)<br>We use an independent inventory company (normally Ready Report) to carry out a Check-In and Check-Out service on all properties (subject to the landlord confirming that they wish to use this service). The cost of a check-in and check-out are identical and can vary from ??108 (including VAT) to ??240 (including VAT) dependent on the size of property and the amount of furnishings in the property. Most normally, tenants pay for a check-in and landlords pay for the check-out. For clarity, check in fees are payable per tenancy, not per applicant.<br><br>Early Termination (Non-optional in the event of leaving earlier than the tenancy allows)<br><br>A fundamental responsibility as a tenant is to pay your rent, but we recognize there may be circumstances whereby you need to break out of your tenancy early. If your Landlord agrees that the property can be re advertised, in order to find a suitable replacement tenant to take over your liability, you still need to continue making your regular rent payments until a new tenant takes occupation. In addition you will need to cover the Landlords fees for the unexpired term of your tenancy. These fees are calculated on a pro rata basis. Should you be thinking of leaving earlier than your tenancy agreement permits, you should contact your local branch as soon as possible for a detailed breakdown of the costs involved.<br><br>Other Fees<br><br>Currell also works on behalf of institutional, rather than private, Landlords who may have their own administration procedures and fees. This can mean that the costs vary from those detailed above. Details of these fees are available upon request, but please be assured that if these landlords charge fees then you will not be liable to pay any fees to us.","longitude":-0.102338,"thumbnail_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/523106c441d1fbf7ceb1fa1a290e40b02b0b45be_80_60.jpg","description":" Key features: ???

It has off-street parking space for two cars. The house is set around a south-facing garden at the front, with a decked seating area, lawn and borders. There is a small secondary area of outside space to the rear.The site was formerly a garden, and had several protected trees that have been retained. The plan of the house is l-shaped, with rooms set at half levels off the main stair, and the spaces interconnect with a minimum of circulation space. This provides all the advantages of open-plan living while still allowing for the practicality, privacy and separation afforded by individual rooms.The exterior of the building is finished in reclaimed mixed red stock bricks with minimal metal-framed windows. Floors are wide Douglas-fir planks, with concrete tiles in the kitchen and dining area on the ground floor. There is underfloor heating throughout and Bang & Olufsen audio in every major room.Powell Tuck Associates is a highly respected architectural practice set up by Julian Powell Tuck in 1990. Its highly contextual buildings artfully combine classicism with modernity. In the practice's own words, they are \"designed to age gracefully\".Castle Close is a quiet cul-de-sac of residential properties located off Wimbledon Parkside, with the open spaces of Wimbledon Common on the doorstep. The famous All England Tennis Club and the amenities of Wimbledon Village are close at hand, and the area is renowned for its excellent schools, most notably, the highly rated King's College School, and Wimbledon and Putney High Schools.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43389957?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"This sensational four-bedroom house was completed in 2010 to a design by Powell Tuck Associates.

(Up to 45K)Deliciously Charming Freehold House set within the delightful Kenway Village Conservation Area. Unusually for such a chocolate box property, this house boasts nearly 50 ft of lateral entertainment living space and a wonderful 34 ft west facing private garden all over the ground floor. The luminous modern kitchen extension is a real breath taker to behold. Upstairs, you'll find three good sized double bedrooms and two modern bathrooms; there is room to extend at the rear if one needed more bedrooms than that and add a terrace or two as other houses along the row have done. If you're even more ambitious than that, a basement dig could create a whole extra floor level, again, as other properties have also done recently in the village. The existing house however, is perfectly proportioned and laid out as it stands.

Up on the fifth floor, this warehouse apartment is prime waterfront and has great natural light as well as classic style. It has a large living area and a dining area just off the kitchen. The kitchen is fitted with a contemporary kitchen and has a utility/larder room. The kitchen could be incorporated into the living area (subject to freeholder consent). Bedroom 1 and 2 open onto a south-facing bridge terrace which has a view up and down the historic Shad Thames whilst the living room opens onto a large waterfront balcony where the breath-taking view takes in Tower Bridge, the river and Canary Wharf.Butlers Wharf is in a prime location, right next to Tower Bridge and provides a 24 hour concierge. It is on Shad Thames - a cobbled street flanked by Victorian warehouses connected by gangways and from which this peaceful, waterfront neighbourhood takes its name. Many residents walk to their work in the City and are spoilt for choice of good restaurants that flank the river. The area is soon to welcome The Ivy at One Tower Bridge as well as the London Theatre Company. With so many good things happening in the immediate area and at nearby London Bridge, this is not only a great place to live but an excellent investment too.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/41393981?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Up on the fifth floor, this warehouse apartment is prime waterfront and has great natural light as well as classic style.","outcode":"SE1","property_report_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/area-report/?listing_id=41393981&z_cmp=property%20report&z_con=get%20a%20report&z_med=propinfo%20link&z_src=ios-for-sale","image_645_430_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/b51c13852889853657e8ce341dedd30780ad11de_645_430.jpg","county":"London","price":"2500000","listing_id":"41393981","image_caption":"Picture No. 02","image_80_60_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/b51c13852889853657e8ce341dedd30780ad11de_80_60.jpg","status":"for_sale","agent_name":"Anderson Rose","num_recepts":"0","country":"England","first_published_date":"2017-03-29 23:26:43","displayable_address":"Butlers Wharf Building, 36 Shad Thames, London SE1","floor_plan":["https://lc.zoocdn.com/59ed9d84b1a5f6f4af02fd4d11b5762eef8936d4.jpg"],"street_name":"36 Shad Thames London","num_bathrooms":"0","agent_logo":"https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(244899).png","price_change":[{"direction":"","date":"2017-03-29 18:12:37","percent":"0%","price":"2500000"}],"agent_phone":"020 3641 4944","image_354_255_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/b51c13852889853657e8ce341dedd30780ad11de.jpg","image_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/b51c13852889853657e8ce341dedd30780ad11de.jpg","last_published_date":"2017-03-29 23:26:43"},{"country_code":"gb","num_floors":"0","image_150_113_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/150/113/1e2fdcad9f32c0e7e633888241ffd2d8b46b431b.jpg","listing_status":"sale","num_bedrooms":"3","image_50_38_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/1e2fdcad9f32c0e7e633888241ffd2d8b46b431b_50_38.jpg","latitude":51.550175,"agent_address":"438 High Road, Wembley","category":"Residential","property_type":"Semi-detached house","letting_fees":"Per Property - ??275<br>Per Person - ??75<br>Guarantor Fee (One Free) - ??50<br>Check Out Fee: -<br>Studio/1 Bed - ??50<br>2 Bed - ??75<br>3 Bed - ??100<br>4 Bed - ??125<br>5 Bed - ??150<br>Renewal Fee - ??150","longitude":-0.274892,"thumbnail_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/1e2fdcad9f32c0e7e633888241ffd2d8b46b431b_80_60.jpg","description":"Offers around ??500,000.

The Grange is the name given to the grandest house in the development because it occupies the entire front of the original Georgian school building.Each home is absolutely unique and different from its neighbour.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43389486?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"The Mews Terrace North' is set within the brand new and exclusive development 'Grange Hall' and offer the option of top-floor terraces and gated courtyards.
