I could write about the pros of this property all day long and in my opinion I can honestly say that there are no cons.Situated on a residential road you will find that this home is perfectly located for public transport links and local amenities.Just a short stroll will take you to the local high street where all the essentials are available. The flat itself is simply divine and has been well maintained by the current owners. As you enter you are immediately greeted by the entrance hall which welcomes you from the start. All the bedrooms are spacious with ample storage and room for even the largest of furniture.The lounge is ideal for entertaining guests no mater whether the occasion is formal or informal. You will enjoy preparing delicious meals in the kitchen; it will not be a chore even if you have to do it every day.There is also off-road parking (permit supplied from management company). Without doubt this property is an amazing buy and will sell in the blink of an eye, so if you want a chance of living in a dream home then you must call immediately to view!What the Owner says:We moved here a ten years ago. The location was key for us as we commute to London daily, so the fact that South Croydon station is only three minutes away has been amazing. We have really enjoyed relaxing in front of the fire in the lounge - you are able to burn your own fuel which is very cosy in winter!Since living here we have maintained the property and modernised it to our standard of living. Whilst we are close to transport links and Croydon's vast array of shops and restaurants, the area itself is very peaceful and tranquil and the neighbours are lovely. We will be sad to leave but know we are passing on a great home.Room sizes:Ground floorEntrance HallLounge 13'9 x 10'0 (4.19m x 3.05m)Kitchen 7'1 x 7'1 (2.16m x 2.16m)Bedroom 1 14'3 x 8'10 (4.35m x 2.69m)Bedroom 2 9'11 x 7'2 (3.02m x 2.19m)Bedroom 3 10'1 x 7'3 (3.08m x 2.21m)BathroomOutsideCommunal GroundsOff-Road ParkingThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.
