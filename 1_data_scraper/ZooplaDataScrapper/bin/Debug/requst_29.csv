We originally looked at a few other two bedroom apartments, but we found they were a little bit too pokey and limited with storage and entertaining space, where as our apartment feels like a penthouse! We have great views of Olympic Park, Victoria Park and the city. Our view is also protected because lldc masterplan for the area will keep building heights well below our line of sight. We can get into the city within 30 minutes as access to Stratford is great and easy. The apartment feels very private and like a proper home, as were not overlooked by anyone and there are no flats above us, it defiantly makes it feel much homelier.

It's just minutes in an Uber to Heathrow airport but being due north you don't have to panic about any planes on their final descent screaming over your rooftop.The property in question is a grade 2 listed period home thought to date back to the 16th or 17th Century that was at different times the local shop and post office until it was converted into a residential property in the latter part of the last century. After a very sympathetic redevelopment it now offers comfortable and stylish accommodation retaining as much of the originality as possible without compromising the integrity of the space. Just wandering around is an experience in itself, loads of nooks and crannies to explore with original timber frames, higgledy piggledy floor, wonderfully preserved doors and an overwhelming sense of stepping back in time.Upstairs three cosy bedrooms and bathroom awaits you coupled with a pleasantly surprising amount of storage space to add to that.Back to the ground floor. As much of the originality is creatively woven into a thoroughly modern space. For a start, the ample kitchen/diner offers family and entertaining space whilst the "snug" to rear of the house is a marvellous room to park the family and sit in front of that glorious wood burning stove.The oversized entrance hall is a grand space that could easily accommodate a home study.Then, moving to the outside, the house just keeps giving. There's a totally private garden with slated floor, all framed by wisteria clad walls that leads onto a detached one and half car garage that currently houses the usual boxed up collection of bits and bobs but with a bit of imagination could be transformed into a stunning summer house or separate home office or guest accommodation (stp).The chocolate box setting of the property is gloriously fronted by a village green with parking on street.
