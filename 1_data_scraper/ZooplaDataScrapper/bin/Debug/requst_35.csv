The development also has brilliant transport links with Isleworth railway station and Osterley underground station in close proximity.From the mainly South-facing roof gardens and terraces, to the full-height glazing and double aspects, life at London Square Isleworth is all about living in light. This striking modern building has been carefully designed to ensure every single home is naturally bright and beautifully airy, with generous living spaces indoors and out.Completion expected Q3/4 2017Great Transport LinksIsleworth train station (Zone 4) is just a 3-minute walk away, where as many as six trains an hour will whisk you to Waterloo in less than 40 minutes. Alternatively, you can access the underground at Osterley, which is a 25-minute walk or a 13 minute bike ride away, where journeys into central London take around half an hour.There is no fewer than five buses stops right outside, including the night bus to Aldwych or Heathrow. There are also direct routes to Shepherds Bush, Hounslow, Brentford and Twickenham.The road links are excellent. Traffic permitting, you can be on the M4 in just 15 minutes. If you're heading into town, the A4 is a few streets away, taking you through Chiswick and Hammersmith into Knightsbridge.You couldn't be better connected for air travel, with Heathrow just a 20-minute cab ride, and all other London airports Gatwick, City, Stansted and Luton are less than an hour away.LocationDesirable for centuries, this part of London has some of the last surviving period palaces and country homes.Known as the palace of palaces, Osterley Park in Isleworth itself, and is now owned by the National Trust. Another close neighbour is the Duke of Northumberlands Syon Park. His 200-acre estate has been in the family for over 400 years. But you're welcome to visit the house, grounds and on-site Hilton Hotel.Independent stores on St Johns Road, moments from the development sell everything from flowers to stationery, baked goods to bike parts, deli-fare to French-inspired furniture. There's a cluster of shops, caf??s and restaurants on South Street too.For upmarket fashion and department stores, pop over to the chic streets of Richmond, around a 25 minute journey away. Or head to the retail-mecca that is Westfield, around half an hour from Isleworth, with its vast choice of high street and designer stores, just a short drive away. Chiswick, again around half an hours journey is your place to seek out stylish interiors. While day-to-day groceries can be bought at any of the numerous supermarkets in the area, from the Waitrose around 20 minutes away in Twickenham to the Tesco Express just up the road.The local pub, The Rising Sun is just a walk away and if you head down to the river, youll find The Red Lion pub is one of the best waterside spots in London. Jazz fans will love the Red Lion too, renowned for its live music events and cracking real ale.Eating out, youre within walking distance from a wealth of choice. Some of the best are Sizlers for Italian or Anjums for curry, while Hei Hing Caf?? and Noodle Bar is so good you need to book. Try Syon Caf?? for that leisurely weekend breakfast or South Street for top-notch coffee and a catch up with Rowan, the owner.These particulars are not intended to, and do not offer or form part of any contract and whilst these sales particulars are believed to be correct, their accuracy is in no way guaranteed.
