Sited on the Victoria and Northern lines they allow for fast entry and exit from central London. Tubes run to Kings Cross, Oxford Street, Victoria and Bank (changing at Kings Cross for the City line). Main line trains leaving from Essex Road Station provide easy access to routes in and around London and links to journeys out of London.

Driving into town, Upper Street leads to the Euston Road where you can pick up routes into the West End and beyond.Location Overview:From the heart of Islington you can explore other equally interesting neighbourhoods. Canonbury is an enclave of elegant Georgian town-houses and quiet leafy squares, with some excellent pub-restaurants and the delightful Estorick Gallery, specialising in Italian art. Hoxton and Shoreditch are nearby boroughs with an urban feel, and include the often-controversial White Cube Gallery and a great choice of bars, clubs and restaurants.10 minute to Co-op Supermarket on New North Road10 minute from Prince Regent Canal (good for walking, jogging or cycling down)5 minutes from Shoreditch ParkSports and leisure venues in Islington are numerous and varied. They include Fitness First, the large Sobell Leisure Centre and Highbury Pool. And, as any Arsenal fan knows, the futuristic new Emirates Stadium in Highbury. Like any inner London area, Islington has its share of little parks and squares to enjoy and relax in. Another hidden gem very close to Shepperton Road is a stretch of the Grand Union Canal, where you can take quiet tow-path strolls, passing colourful narrow boats and spotting wildlife.Terms:Tenure: LeaseholdLease Length: Approx 100 YearsService Charges: Approx ??1400.00Ground Rent: TbcPrice: Offers in excess of ??475,000** Misrepresentation Act 1967 **These particulars are believed to be correct but their accuracy is not guaranteed nor do they form part of any contract.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/37867083?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Modern Factory Conversion...Fully Fitted Kitchen...Modern Interior...Spacious Property...Secure Parking Space...Great Location...Good Transport Links...Viewing Essential...","outcode":"N1","property_report_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/area-report/?listing_id=37867083&z_cmp=property%20report&z_con=get%20a%20report&z_med=propinfo%20link&z_src=ios-for-sale","image_645_430_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/b870182051ba16c0d56d8ee8831dd0aca75a6f1f.jpg","county":"London","price":"475000","listing_id":"37867083","image_caption":"","image_80_60_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/b870182051ba16c0d56d8ee8831dd0aca75a6f1f_80_60.jpg","status":"for_sale","agent_name":"Arlington Estates","num_recepts":"0","country":"England","first_published_date":"2017-04-04 14:45:17","displayable_address":"Shepperton Road, Canonbury N1","price_modifier":"offers_over","floor_plan":["https://lc.zoocdn.com/51d937bfac7bbd9877b3fddf7732657d84a86897.jpg"],"street_name":"Shepperton Road","num_bathrooms":"1","agent_logo":"https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(27387).gif","price_change":[{"direction":"","date":"2017-04-04 14:44:08","percent":"0%","price":"475000"}],"agent_phone":"020 3463 9585","image_354_255_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/b870182051ba16c0d56d8ee8831dd0aca75a6f1f.jpg","image_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/b870182051ba16c0d56d8ee8831dd0aca75a6f1f.jpg","last_published_date":"2017-04-04 14:52:53"},{"country_code":"gb","num_floors":"0","image_150_113_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/d2537574da5a2b5ae69a77538541a870f53daa41_150_113.jpg","listing_status":"sale","num_bedrooms":"2","image_50_38_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/d2537574da5a2b5ae69a77538541a870f53daa41_50_38.jpg","latitude":51.47539,"agent_address":"39 Camberwell Church Street, London","category":"Residential","property_type":"Flat","longitude":-0.08186,"thumbnail_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/d2537574da5a2b5ae69a77538541a870f53daa41_80_60.jpg","description":"Cash buyers only...Two double bedroom split level apartment newly renovated to an exacting standard.
