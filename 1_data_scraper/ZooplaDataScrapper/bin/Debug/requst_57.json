Constructed in 1718 by John James, Park Hall is said to have been the residence of Sir James Thornhill, painter of the ceiling in the Painted Hall of the Royal Naval College. The original facade with subsequent additions circa 1803, its fine red brick with rusticated stucco quoins, heavy stucco cornice mouldings and dental above the second floor are just a few of the features that make this one of the finest examples of 18th/19th-century architecture in Royal Greenwich.Occupying the entire first floor of the freehold building the apartment provides its resident with serene calm and quiet seclusion from its lofty vantage over Crooms Hill. The south-west facing private hardwood roof terrace provides the perfect venue for long, lazy summer lunches and sunset drinks with friends; there are fine views of the Heath to the left, with church spires and glimpses of the Gerkin to the right, all bathed in the resplendent serenity of the 17th century Manor House directly opposite.Built on the summit of the same hill on which stands Greenwich's Royal Observatory, the Park Hall of Georgian England faced directly onto the park and away from what is now the street side of Crooms Hill and the building's current front facade. In the 18th and 19th centuries, residents came to and fro via the quaint and enduring cobbled lane that runs between Park Hall and the upper western gate to the Royal Park. As a result, the original front door to the building is situated at what is now the back of the property, so while the apartment enjoys a first-floor aspect on the Crooms Hillside, it is however not constrained by the associated drawbacks of the typical first-floor property. The apartment constitutes the entire reception level of what was the 18th-century house, including the original main door and hall entrance with three hundred-year-old stone floors and neoclassical columns intact. This unofficial main entrance gives directly onto Park Hall's glorious gardens with south facing aspect, from which walled oasis one must take only a few strolled steps along the cobbled lane before emerging through the ancient Royal walls into the park, or otherwise onto the Heath or street fifty yards further up Crooms Hill than the official entrance to the property.Inside the apartment offers a host of creature comforts. Its marble bathrooms offer a touch of modern opulence, with smartphone-controlled heated floors, wet room walk in shower, deep soaking tub, and luxury period bathroom fittings. The Nero Marquina-Calcutta palette of marble echoes the wet room's long narrow art deco window feature and the 1920s flourishes that quietly augment the building, courtesy of its 1920s division and re-imagining into the five apartments that exist today.High ceilings and generous room sizes recall a bygone era, bestowing upon the resident a way of life rarely enjoyed in 21st century London. The working Edwardian fireplace in the breakfast room pays homage to one of this space's previous incarnations as a parlour or antechamber to the drawing room, yet now as part of an open plan kitchen-dining ensemble, space provides the modern resident with an informal dining area and additional reception in which to entertain.The drawing room boasts a large ornate antique French marble fireplace, intricate period cornice and ceiling rose and the wonderfully warm aged parquet floors that extend throughout all of the non-tiled rooms of the apartment. The master bedroom is adorned with a large black marble Victorian fireplace and fine panelled walls. Similarly, excellent panelling can be found in the formal dining room, which also enjoys the splendour of a fine baroque marble fireplace. There are original working recessed shutters in all windows, and the apartment benefits from extensive shelving, cupboards and window seats built into the panelling and alcoves throughout the apartment, offering convenience and versatility of use. The passageway between the kitchen and the formal dining room can convert into a closet, closing off the room from the kitchen in order to provide the resident with a choice between either an additional reception/formal dining room or a three bedroom, two bathroom set up.This is truly a unique apartment within a unique building, blessed with a location arguably unsurpassed in London. Period character, beauty, elegance and luxurious modern comfort are cocooned within enchanting gardens, sheltered by three-hundred-year-old walls adjacent to the historic Royal Greenwich Park. A super smart, private first-floor residence with the ground floor convenience of garden, park and street access that would be perfect for a future resident at any stage of life.

Handsome Victorian and Edwardian homes are the order of the day, and the central focus is the large private garden square for residents; being one grants you a key. This ground floor garden flat of 70 square metres (inclusive of a useful cellar) has been carefully and professionally designed and renovated recently, and offers up two bedrooms, a hotel-style bathroom, and a huge reception room that???s open-plan to a modern kitchen which opens out onto a generous garden of almost 40ft. The property also benefits from a posh lighting scheme with 4-setting Lutron system. You???re mere moments from Peckham Rye Park and Common???s 113 acres. Day and night bus routes run along Peckham Rye up to the City and beyond, and your nearest stations are East Dulwich and Peckham Rye stations (the latter is on the London Overground line). On-street parking is available and plentiful. Leasehold.Open the main, original front door into a neat shared hall space. The flat???s own front door sits off to the left. Open into a lobby area, noting classy decor from the off. To your left is a large master bedroom (15ft by 11ft) with huge built-in wardrobes taking an entire wall. A deep bay window is graced with on-trend plantation shutters. The bathroom has large format tiling and contemporary sanitaryware, including wall-hung w.C., and stainless steel fittings. A high-spec. Overbath shower and recessed lightings are further welcome touches. The second bedroom has high ceilings (as you???ll note throughout the property) and French doors that open out to the side return section of the garden. Back to the hall and through, pass the door to the cellar on your right, you open into the centre of the home: A sizeable, solid-wood floored reception and dining room of 16ft by 13ft. Alcove cupboards and shelving sit either side of the chimney breast (of charcoal Venetian plaster finish) with original and working Victorian fireplace. The kitchen lies open-plan to the reception, giving the entire room a double-aspect. The beautifully-planned, slick, modern fitted kitchen is a white affair with built-in appliances. The hexagonally-tiled floor is fabulous. More mostly-glazed French doors open out here to the garden proper this time.The garden is an impressive, largely-tiled, low-maintenance space with generous planting areas, too. A real ???outside room???, if ever there was one! The perfect space for entertaining friends and family. Now???s a good time to mention the side access to the garden (owing to the semi-detached nature of the building). Handy for guests and bikes alike.This is a particularly leafy and quiet part of town that???ll likely leave you never wanting to leave for the country. Peaceful yet well connected though ??? East Dulwich and Peckham Centres are each a short walk (15mins). We love Lordship Lane with its independent shops, pubs and restaurants, and Bellenden Road for the same in a more boutique setting. East Dulwich Picturehouse and Peckham Plex cinema are close, as is The Bussey Building & Copeland Park on Rye Lane (check out The Nines for happy hour cocktails, and Forza Win for friendly Italian dining). Bussey and Frank???s rooftop bars are a must visit in the warmest months. Local foodie restaurants include a handful of our favourites: Peckham Bazaar, Banh Banh, Mr Bao, Miss Tapas and Pedler. Cafe G and Cafe on the Rye are lovely, super local spots for a coffee and pastry, or fry-up.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43383924?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"The Gardens ??? located in East Dulwich/Peckham Rye borderland ??? is a much-envied address of the pretty, quiet and residential variety.

Alcove cupboards and shelving sit either side of the chimney breast (of charcoal Venetian plaster finish) with original and working Victorian fireplace. The kitchen lies open-plan to the reception, giving the entire room a double-aspect. The beautifully-planned, slick, modern fitted kitchen is a white affair with built-in appliances. The hexagonally-tiled floor is fabulous. More mostly-glazed French doors open out here to the garden proper this time.  The garden is an impressive, largely-tiled, low-maintenance space with generous planting areas, too. A real ???outside room???, if ever there was one! The perfect space for entertaining friends and family. Now???s a good time to mention the side access to the garden (owing to the semi-detached nature of the building). Handy for guests and bikes alike.  This is a particularly leafy and quiet part of town that???ll likely leave you never wanting to leave for the country. Peaceful yet well connected though ??? East Dulwich and Peckham Centres are each a short walk (15mins). We love Lordship Lane with its independent shops, pubs and restaurants, and Bellenden Road for the same in a more boutique setting. East Dulwich Picturehouse and Peckham Plex cinema are close, as is The Bussey Building &amp; Copeland Park on Rye Lane (check out The Nines for happy hour cocktails, and Forza Win for friendly Italian dining). Bussey and Frank???s rooftop bars are a must visit in the warmest months. Local foodie restaurants include a handful of our favourites: Peckham Bazaar, Banh Banh, Mr Bao, Miss Tapas and Pedler. Cafe G and Cafe on the Rye are lovely, super local spots for a coffee and pastry, or fry-up.","outcode":"SE22","property_report_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/area-report/?listing_id=43383924&z_cmp=property%20report&z_con=get%20a%20report&z_med=propinfo%20link&z_src=ios-for-sale","image_645_430_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/35b2c0005b54d8e985e693a32542772b9281afc5_645_430.jpg","county":"London","price":"650000","listing_id":"43383924","image_caption":"","image_80_60_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/35b2c0005b54d8e985e693a32542772b9281afc5_80_60.jpg","status":"for_sale","agent_name":"Munday's, London","num_recepts":"0","country":"England","first_published_date":"2017-03-29 12:48:58","displayable_address":"The Gardens, East Dulwich SE22","floor_plan":["https://lc.zoocdn.com/990e4622c0f8f57f19911fa52c0fad85d026536d.jpg"],"street_name":"The Gardens","num_bathrooms":"1","agent_logo":"https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(304049).png","price_change":[{"direction":"","date":"2017-03-29 12:45:17","percent":"0%","price":"650000"}],"agent_phone":"020 8022 4441","image_354_255_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/35b2c0005b54d8e985e693a32542772b9281afc5_354_255.jpg","image_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/35b2c0005b54d8e985e693a32542772b9281afc5_354_255.jpg","last_published_date":"2017-03-29 21:24:31"},{"country_code":"gb","num_floors":"0","image_150_113_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/837102a63cd1ae76078548a5b03f193f02fdce41_150_113.jpg","listing_status":"sale","num_bedrooms":"2","image_50_38_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/837102a63cd1ae76078548a5b03f193f02fdce41_50_38.jpg","latitude":51.62684,"agent_address":"Columbia House\r\nColumbia Drive, Worthing","category":"Residential","property_type":"Semi-detached house","longitude":-0.017368,"thumbnail_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/837102a63cd1ae76078548a5b03f193f02fdce41_80_60.jpg","description":"Purchasing this property with A lifetime leaseThis property is offered at a reduced price for the over 60s under Homewise's Home for Life Plan.
