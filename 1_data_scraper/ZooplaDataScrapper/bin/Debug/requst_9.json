This outstanding Victorian terrace has been finished to an exceptional standard, for a high functioning yet welcoming family space. This is a real find for a family looking for a home in a tranquil yet thriving neighbourhood, surrounded by excellent schools, beautiful parks, award winning restaurants and delis.A prime example of a real family home on arguably the best road in the highly sought after 'Bury Triangle' in South Fulham. This outstanding Victorian terrace has been finished to an exceptional standard, for a high functioning yet welcoming family space. This is a real find for a family looking for a home in a tranquil yet thriving neighbourhood, surrounded by excellent schools, beautiful parks, award winning restaurants and delis.Arranged over four equally impressive floors, the internal accommodation is generous and well thought out. The raised ground floor consists of an impeccable, dual aspect double reception space with the feature staircase leading up and down to the other floors.The awesome eat-in kitchen space takes up the majority of the lower ground floor. This large space has been designed perfectly for family living. A perfect breakfast area/soft reception space opens out to the sleek, modern kitchen with central island boasting a vast number of fitted cabinets and integrated, high-spec appliances perfectly completed with a muted granite countertop and breakfast bar. Behind the kitchen area and in front of the full width bi-fold doors is plenty of room for a sizeable dining table.To the front of this floor is the fourth bedroom and a well-designed guest cloakroom and utility space.The first floor plays host to two generous double bedrooms and the picture perfect family bathroom. Beautifully fitted with a freestanding bath, separate shower and bespoke vanity unit framed by the elegant grey palette of the imported Italian tiled walls and floor.The entirety of the second floor is given over to the master bedroom complete with a large bank of wardrobes and having its own stylish ensuite bathroom. Although the house is certainly large enough, the second floor does give opportunity to increase the size and value further by way of adding a 'pod' extension (subject to the usual planning permissions and constraints).This family home is beautifully presented to the front and rear exteriors and has a low-maintenance, landscaped rear garden space directly accessed through the bi-fold doors in the kitchen making for a lovely extension to the internal space come summer.Attention to detail has been paid throughout, the house was re-roofed in 2013 and has underfloor water heating throughout lower ground floor, underfloor heating in the bathrooms, a monitored alarm system and an integrated Sonos sound system naming but a few of the improvements that have helped transform this beautiful Victorian terrace for modern family living.Hazlebury Road is in a superb position for the popular wine bars, exciting restaurants and amenities on both Wandsworth Bridge Road and New Kings Road while both green spaces of South Park and Eel Brook Common are close at hand. Situated in especially close proximity to a host of popular schools including Fulham Bi-lingual school on Clancarty Road and l'Ecole Des Petites at the north end of Hazlebury Road.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43476400?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"A prime example of a real family home on arguably the best road in the highly sought after 'Bury Triangle' in South Fulham.

Looking for the perfect home can prove to be a real struggle - especially if you want to live in the highly contested and coveted 'Park Farm' area. So as you are nestled in one of the area's most prestigious residential locations, this beautiful house sits pride of place in an extremely convenient part of the road, having had every effort made by the current owners to keep the property up to the highest standards possible. Having been extended, the layout at the rear of this home is undeniably perfect for get togethers and socialising and the current owners regularly have a family of fifteen people for dinner with ease. The kitchen area is stunning with stylish units and worktop space and room for all the cookery books you can lay your hands on. The dining area has the space for the table and chairs and is open so ideal for catching up with everyone as you cook. Add to that the great size garden room extension which has plenty of room for sofas and the television and you have yourself some pretty impressive living space that you'll find hard to tear yourself away from. If you do fancy watching something different on the telly or you fancy some quiet time, there is also the separate lounge away from the hub of the back of the home. Upstairs, the bedrooms are tastefully decorated and the family bathroom is a great place to relax after a long day at work. Outside it just gets better and better, with a wonderful level rear garden that provides a place for family and friends to get together.What the Owner says:We bought this house 17 years ago and can remember walking through the door and finally thinking we had found \"the one.\" We loved the space it offered and could totally see ourselves living here and the potential. The location was and still is ideal as it offers us everything we ever needed. Two train stations within walking distance, good schools and the town centre all easily accessible. Not to mention the bus routes virtually right outside our front door. Since living here, we have extended and had a new kitchen installed complete with integrated appliances and we also had the windows replaced. We had new flooring put down and redecorated throughout. We did think about converting the loft but decided we didn't really need the extra space.Room sizes:Entrance HallLounge 13'3 x 11'9 (4.04m x 3.58m)Kitchen Area 8'3 x 8'1 (2.52m x 2.47m)Dining Area 11'5 x 9'4 (3.48m x 2.85m)Garden Room Extension 17'5 x 8'7 (5.31m x 2.62m)HallwayBedroom 3 8'5 x 6'2 (2.57m x 1.88m)Bedroom 1 13'3 x 11'3 (4.04m x 3.43m)Bedroom 2 11'7 x 11'3 (3.53m x 3.43m)BathroomDrivewayRear GardenThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

There are a total of nine sealed chimney breasts ready to be returned to former glory, plus high ceiling bedrooms. Ample parking at the rear can accommodate four cars.
