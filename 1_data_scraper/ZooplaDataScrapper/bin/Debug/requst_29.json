The development is located within a short walk of Pudding Mill Lane DLR station and Stratford High Street. Westfield Stratford is also within close proximity, offering a wide range of shops, bars and restaurants.\"What the vendor says: We really love the space and high ceilings this apartment gives us, together with the double height space and floor to ceiling windows there is loads of natural light. We originally looked at a few other two bedroom apartments, but we found they were a little bit too pokey and limited with storage and entertaining space, where as our apartment feels like a penthouse! We have great views of Olympic Park, Victoria Park and the city. Our view is also protected because lldc masterplan for the area will keep building heights well below our line of sight. We can get into the city within 30 minutes as access to Stratford is great and easy. The apartment feels very private and like a proper home, as were not overlooked by anyone and there are no flats above us, it defiantly makes it feel much homelier. Were right by the river and like going into Hackney Wick to all the bars and restaurants.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43434493?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Stunning, two double bedroom, split-level apartment situated within the ever popular George Hudson Tower.

The size of the rooms and the well-designed layout, which creates a lovely open-plan feeling, were the main reasons for us buying the property off-plan in the first place. Being right next to Furze Green is great for relaxing or kicking a ball about in the afternoons or at the weekend. The location is perfect; just a couple of minutes' walk to Devons Road DLR or a short Santander cycle to Mile End or Bow. Plus, the City, Canary Wharf and Stratford are all within 10 minutes. Canary Wharf is great for its retail centres, restaurants and cinema, as is Stratford in the other direction for the Westfield Shopping Centre or the Olympic Park. There are also numerous amenities in the surrounding area, including Mile End Leisure Centre and Victoria Park, plus great access to the A12 and A13.

It's just minutes in an Uber to Heathrow airport but being due north you don't have to panic about any planes on their final descent screaming over your rooftop.The property in question is a grade 2 listed period home thought to date back to the 16th or 17th Century that was at different times the local shop and post office until it was converted into a residential property in the latter part of the last century. After a very sympathetic redevelopment it now offers comfortable and stylish accommodation retaining as much of the originality as possible without compromising the integrity of the space. Just wandering around is an experience in itself, loads of nooks and crannies to explore with original timber frames, higgledy piggledy floor, wonderfully preserved doors and an overwhelming sense of stepping back in time.Upstairs three cosy bedrooms and bathroom awaits you coupled with a pleasantly surprising amount of storage space to add to that.Back to the ground floor. As much of the originality is creatively woven into a thoroughly modern space. For a start, the ample kitchen/diner offers family and entertaining space whilst the \"snug\" to rear of the house is a marvellous room to park the family and sit in front of that glorious wood burning stove.The oversized entrance hall is a grand space that could easily accommodate a home study.Then, moving to the outside, the house just keeps giving. There's a totally private garden with slated floor, all framed by wisteria clad walls that leads onto a detached one and half car garage that currently houses the usual boxed up collection of bits and bobs but with a bit of imagination could be transformed into a stunning summer house or separate home office or guest accommodation (stp).The chocolate box setting of the property is gloriously fronted by a village green with parking on street. West Drayton Station, which is due to become part of Crossrail in 2019 is a few minutes on foot with its services to Paddington.","post_town":"West Drayton","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43433884?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"  A beautiful 3 bedroom property in a picturesque village setting.

Details of these fees are as follows:<br><br>Administration Fees (Non-optional)<br>We charge ??150 (including VAT) to cover the cost of administration of the tenancy. For clarity, this is a charge per tenancy and not per applicant.<br><br>Referencing Fees (Non-optional)<br>We use an independent referencing agency (rmt - Reference-My-Tenant) to carry out reference checks on all tenants. The cost of these checks are ??35 (including VAT) per individual joining the tenancy and ??50 (including VAT) if a company is being referenced. For clarity, each individual named in the tenancy agreement will need to pay a referencing fee. For example, 3 tenants = 3 referencing fees.<br><br>Check-In Fees (Non optional in the event that the Landlord uses the services of an Independent Inventory Clerk)<br>We use an independent inventory company (normally Ready Report) to carry out a Check-In and Check-Out service on all properties (subject to the landlord confirming that they wish to use this service). The cost of a check-in and check-out are identical and can vary from ??108 (including VAT) to ??240 (including VAT) dependent on the size of property and the amount of furnishings in the property. Most normally, tenants pay for a check-in and landlords pay for the check-out. For clarity, check in fees are payable per tenancy, not per applicant.<br><br>Early Termination (Non-optional in the event of leaving earlier than the tenancy allows)<br><br>A fundamental responsibility as a tenant is to pay your rent, but we recognize there may be circumstances whereby you need to break out of your tenancy early. If your Landlord agrees that the property can be re advertised, in order to find a suitable replacement tenant to take over your liability, you still need to continue making your regular rent payments until a new tenant takes occupation. In addition you will need to cover the Landlords fees for the unexpired term of your tenancy. These fees are calculated on a pro rata basis. Should you be thinking of leaving earlier than your tenancy agreement permits, you should contact your local branch as soon as possible for a detailed breakdown of the costs involved.<br><br>Other Fees<br><br>Currell also works on behalf of institutional, rather than private, Landlords who may have their own administration procedures and fees. This can mean that the costs vary from those detailed above. Details of these fees are available upon request, but please be assured that if these landlords charge fees then you will not be liable to pay any fees to us.","longitude":-0.100649,"thumbnail_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/f2d77c1b3a3a396fcd891d686ff7b2d577fde9ff_80_60.jpg","description":" Key features: ???
