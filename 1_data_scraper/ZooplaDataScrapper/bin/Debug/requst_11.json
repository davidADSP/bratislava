There is a perfect amount of space for you to dine and relax in with your loved ones. The living room faces the front and not only overlooks the front garden but has lovely views of the green too. They say the kitchen is the heart of the home and that certainly is the case here. Spending time in the kitchen creating some lovely dishes for your friends and family to sample will be something you can really get stuck into living here.Upstairs there are two wonderful sized bedrooms, if for the first few years of being a homeowner you needed to rent a room out to give your income and extra boost the second bedroom is a more than suitable size.For the green fingered there is a great garden to potter about in or ???grow your own???.Properties like this are hard to find, don???t leave it too late.The information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

There's a pretty double bedroom and a large bathroom at the rear. The garden is shared. Camberwell Grove is leafy, architecturally beautiful and well located for town, with Denmark Hill station just five minutes on foot.The magnificent flat-fronted building enjoys a well maintained front garden and invites you from the road through a pleasant, walled green space. A giant Georgian door delivers you to the communal lobby with stairs leading you to flat's entrance on the first floor. To your left, right across the front of the house, is a 21ft by 16ft open plan living area. The three sashes flood the room with light. To the right are shelves in each alcove. Along the left hand wall is a swish, streamlined kitchen with integrated appliances. Back out and facing the reception room is a peaceful double bedroom, with a huge sash window in one angled section of wall (this faces east so you get the morning sun). The decor is rich, deep and dreamy. A door leads from the bedroom to a big bathroom containing a white suite with which mosaic tiles around the bath, wooden floors and a large sash window looking over the shared garden.Denmark Hill station (Zone 2) offers fast, regular services to Victoria and London Bridge (it's a 10 minute walk).
