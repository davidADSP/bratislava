The property was refurbished in recent years and now provides a superb family home with beautiful South East facing garden of approximately 60???. The property is set over five floors with stunning ???bow back???. The lower ground floor is laid out as a fabulous open Kitchen, Dining and Living space with separate utility room, WC, garden access and front access. The original staircase rises to the raised ground floor where the front door retains the Georgian fanlight; the beautiful double reception room has floor to ceiling doors from the ???bow??? back with steps into the garden. First floor is the master bedroom and bathroom with superb ceiling heights, second floor two bedrooms and bathroom and top floor two bedrooms and shower room. It is worth noting that the three primary bedrooms are all to the rear of the house.This wonderful house is set on Kennington Park Road (an original Roman Road called ???Stane Street???) which was laid out as it currently stands from the 1770s as a fine avenue of townhouses. The area developed after the opening of river crossings at Westminster and Blackfriars, making it much more accessible and houses were built on an ad-hoc basis giving the road a very varied Georgian vista. To the Northern end of the Road is the Elephant and Castle (a huge area of re-generation in central London) and to the Southern is the beautiful Kennington Park, St Marks Church, The Oval cricket Ground and Oval Station; Kennington Station (Northern Line) is located on Kennington Park Road a few minutes??? walk from the house. Kennington Park is steeped in history having originally been Kennington Common from about 1600: It was the site of executions (the Tyburn of the South) until 1800, cricket is recorded as being played at first class level on the common until 1785 and the park itself was enclosed in 1854. The ???Chartists??? used it as their rally point in 1848 and ???William Booth??? (founder of The Salvation Army) preached there in 1852.The house is a short walk to excellent transport links of the Tube, Buses and mainline services from Vauxhall, Elephant & Castle and even Waterloo. It is possible to walk into Westminster, the West End and the City. Kennington offers a lovely selection of fine Pubs, Bars, Restaurants and shops. The White Bear Theatre opposite has recently re-opened after refurbishment and Cleaver Square is a short stroll for a drink in the Prince of Wales pub and a game of ???Petanque??? in the square! Let us not forget Surrey County Cricket Club at the Oval for cricket fans and the highly rated City and Guilds Art School. Kennington is a wonderfully convenient yet residential and verdant place to live in Central London.Freehold","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43443983?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"5 bedroom Georgian terraced house for sale in Kennington SE11.
