With parks, golf courses and a cafe society high street, it is the perfect environment in which to raise a family.Externally, the house shares its frontage between the driveway providing off street parking plus access to the garage and a lush planted area. The south facing back garden is mature and well kept, whilst taking in views over the rear fields.Internally, the house has been extended over time and currently consists of four/five bedrooms, two large reception rooms, kitchen with separate utility room, family bathroom and both an upstairs and downstairs WC. The bedrooms are considered a good size; the reception rooms work well and it is clear that the ground floor study could be used as an annexe for elderly residents thereby providing flexibility of use.However, it is with a keen eye that the possibilities come to life. Without purchasing someone else s idea of a renovation, this house allows you to create and change to your taste and ideal. For example, it could be the case that the buyer would seek to square off the extensions at the rear to create a stunning family room (stpp). The ability to purchase choice and potential, as well as location, is key.This property is a must view.

Externally, the house shares its frontage between the driveway providing off street parking plus access to the garage and a lush planted area. The south facing back garden is mature and well kept, whilst taking in views over the rear fields.  Internally, the house has been extended over time and currently consists of four/five bedrooms, two large reception rooms, kitchen with separate utility room, family bathroom and both an upstairs and downstairs WC. The bedrooms are considered a good size; the reception rooms work well and it is clear that the ground floor study could be used as an annexe for elderly residents thereby providing flexibility of use.  However, it is with a keen eye that the possibilities come to life. Without purchasing someone else s idea of a renovation, this house allows you to create and change to your taste and ideal. For example, it could be the case that the buyer would seek to square off the extensions at the rear to create a stunning family room (stpp). The ability to purchase choice and potential, as well as location, is key.  This property is a must view. With Nonsuch, Cuddington Croft, Glyn, Avenue Primary and St Dunstan s schools in the surrounding areas, this will undoubtedly be a draw for many and will increase popularity.

The beautiful floor tiles flow through to the kitchen/dining room, a space measuring 21 5 x 19 10 and large enough to hold a six-seater dining table and separate seating area.  The kitchen continues the high gloss theme in the crisp, white units and also incorporates a freestanding breakfast island. The vaulted skylight and wide bi-fold doors make the most of the natural light.  Set to the front of the house, the separate sitting room is stunning. Features such as plantation shutters ensure this room is comfortable and contemporary.  Upstairs, the neutral decor enjoyed throughout the downstairs continues in the three bedrooms. The bathroom is sumptuous with its modern white suite of bath, hand basin, low level flush WC and walk-in shower, plus sublime floor to ceiling tiles in soft dove grey.  Externally, the garden is laid to 45mm Chelsea graze artificial lawn ensuring lots of time for relaxing and barbeques rather than mowing! However, raised beds allow the gardener to add colour in the summer. The bi-fold doors open onto a large patio and at the end of the garden is a further patio plus log cabin with power supply which is currently used by the owner as an office.  In summary, this is a house not to be missed for those seeking an up-to-the moment interior, easy access into London via train and well regarded local schools.

These consist of a fridge freezer, dishwasher, frameless glass ceramic hob, extractor hood and an electric fan oven. A washer dryer can be found in the storage cupboard in the hall. Access to the balcony is via a door in the dining area.The master bedroom benefits from a fitted wardrobe and an en suite with shower enclosure, while the remaining bedrooms share the family bathroom. Both bathrooms are presented with white sanitaryware, chrome-finish brassware and tiling to the walls and floors.All bedrooms are carpeted, while the hall, living and kitchen areas are fitted with oak flooring.Dockside is a contemporary development of new homes in London Docklands, comprising a mix of 1,2 and 3-bedroom apartments. All properties are built to a high specification with quality fixtures and fittings, and all enjoy a concierge service. Most apartments boast waterside views and balconies, and many include integrated kitchen appliances.Situated just three minutes walk from Crossharbour DLR station, the development is ideal for professionals working in nearby Canary Wharf, as well as for accessing the many entertainment and leisure opportunities available locally, and in east and central London. For those working in the City of London, Bank is less than 20 minutes away via DLR.Canary Wharf DLR is three stops from the development, giving convenient access to a wealth of shops, restaurants, caf??s and bars, as well as the business district. High-street brands, independent retailers and designer boutiques can be found in the shopping malls of Canada Place, Jubilee Place, Cabot Place and Crossrail Place, while fine dining and casual restaurants offering dishes from around the world, are located throughout the area.London Underground Jubilee Line trains stop at Canary Wharf tube station, which is a few minutes walk from the DLR station. From here frequent services operate to central London???s Green Park and Bond Street to the west, and Stratford to the east, bringing celebrated shopping destinations such as Oxford Street, Regents Street, Marble Arch and Westfield Stratford City within easy reach. A Crossrail station at Canary Wharf is due to open in 2018 with trains linking to central London, Essex, Kent, Buckinghamshire and Berkshire.Despite being one of the uk???s most important financial centres and home to some of the tallest buildings in Europe ??? including 1 Canada Square, the iconic Canary Wharf Tower ??? Docklands is by no means bereft of green space. Jubilee Park lies above Canary Wharf tube station and a rooftop park has been created above the Crossrail station.Just 10 minutes walk from these new homes in Docklands, Mudchute Park and Farm is a nature reserve and working farm with equestrian facilities, while the adjacent Millwall Park offers cycling and running tracks and sports pitches.The O2 Arena at Greenwich Peninsula, a 15-minute car journey away, is a major live music and performance venue. It is part of the O2 entertainment complex, which also includes a multiplex cinema, bowling alley and restaurants.Greenwich is home to the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich Park and the Royal Observatory, while the town centre is popular for dining and shopping, with a historic market open six days a week.Major roads easily accessible from Dockside include the A102 and Blackwall Tunnel, and the A13 for east London and south Essex.For international and domestic air travel London City Airport can be reached in just over 10 minutes by car, or in less than 30 minutes by public transport.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43425338?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"Phenomenal views - must view! 3 Bedroom, 2 bathroom home just five mins to canary wharf, offering fantastic connections into London, outstanding finishes with bk nolte german designer kitchens, beautiful bathrooms and wood flooring &amp; carpet throughout.","outcode":"E14","property_report_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/area-report/?listing_id=43425338&z_cmp=property%20report&z_con=get%20a%20report&z_med=propinfo%20link&z_src=ios-for-sale","image_645_430_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/645/430/70ab5c464dfa2b6f88c823832c8d4d9d7f9a7c58.jpg","new_home":"true","county":"London","price":"799995","listing_id":"43425338","image_caption":"","image_80_60_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/70ab5c464dfa2b6f88c823832c8d4d9d7f9a7c58_80_60.jpg","status":"for_sale","agent_name":"Bellway - Dockside","num_recepts":"0","country":"England","first_published_date":"2017-04-03 08:53:04","displayable_address":"Turnberry Quay, Canary Wharf E14","floor_plan":["https://lc.zoocdn.com/5470ff6e9f332a69d3ed22aaf2367369fb5cfd68.jpg"],"street_name":"Turnberry Quay","num_bathrooms":"2","agent_logo":"https://st.zoocdn.com/zoopla_static_agent_logo_(76268).png","price_change":[{"direction":"","date":"2017-04-03 08:52:06","percent":"0%","price":"799995"}],"agent_phone":"020 8115 9719","image_354_255_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/70ab5c464dfa2b6f88c823832c8d4d9d7f9a7c58.jpg","image_url":"https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/70ab5c464dfa2b6f88c823832c8d4d9d7f9a7c58.jpg","last_published_date":"2017-04-03 08:57:19"},{"country_code":"gb","num_floors":"0","image_150_113_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/b38642cf140132e595cbd5f2c192487308d446f6_150_113.jpg","listing_status":"sale","num_bedrooms":"4","image_50_38_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/b38642cf140132e595cbd5f2c192487308d446f6_50_38.jpg","latitude":51.541428,"agent_address":"97 Chamberlayne Road, London","category":"Residential","property_type":"Terraced house","letting_fees":"Agency referencing fees apply. ??60.00 inclusive VAT per tenant or guarantor.<br>Holding deposits will also be required.","longitude":-0.250895,"thumbnail_url":"https://li.zoocdn.com/b38642cf140132e595cbd5f2c192487308d446f6_80_60.jpg","description":"A well presented Victorian style family home on three floors and comprising 4 double bedrooms (one with built in wardrobes), 2 receptions, kitchen/breakfast room, 'lean to'/conservatory, 2 bathroom/wc's and 38ft south facing rear garden.

Alternatively, you can access the underground at Osterley, which is a 25-minute walk or a 13 minute bike ride away, where journeys into central London take around half an hour.There is no fewer than five buses stops right outside, including the night bus to Aldwych or Heathrow. There are also direct routes to Shepherds Bush, Hounslow, Brentford and Twickenham.The road links are excellent. Traffic permitting, you can be on the M4 in just 15 minutes. If you're heading into town, the A4 is a few streets away, taking you through Chiswick and Hammersmith into Knightsbridge.You couldn't be better connected for air travel, with Heathrow just a 20-minute cab ride, and all other London airports Gatwick, City, Stansted and Luton are less than an hour away.LocationDesirable for centuries, this part of London has some of the last surviving period palaces and country homes.Known as the palace of palaces, Osterley Park in Isleworth itself, and is now owned by the National Trust.

The property sits on a quiet road and offers an incredible amount of potential with regards to extensions and development. The property comprises of three excellent sized bedrooms, two similarly proportioned reception rooms, bathroom and separate toilet, a conservatory, large rear garden, double garage and workshop, large boarded loft with ladder and a private driveway.LocationThe property can be found a short distance from Hillingdon Hosptial and Brunel University making the property a stand out opportunity from a rental prospective, or ideal for professionals and families due to the size and potential of extending (stpp).The road itself is incredibly tranquil and many of the current home owners appear to maintain and look after their properties. The road is populated by mainly semi-detached and detached homes, mainly owner occupied as apposed to rented, signalling the type of area where people enjoy residing long term.The area is also densely populated with many primary and secondary schools and is only a few minutes walk from the nearest bus routes which can connect you to Uxbridge (Met and Piccadilly Line), West Drayton (Crossrail) and an array of shops, restaurants, bars, pubs, clubs, banks and more.Ground FloorAs you enter the front porch and step into the entrance hall, you will immediately notice the recently sanded and varnished Herringbone Parquet flooring which carries through into both the living room and dining room. The hallway also leads to the kitchen and to the first floor via the stairs which are newly carpeted.The living room has a front aspect double glazed window and overlooks the pleasant front garden, parquet flooring, chimney breast, power sockets and light.The dining room has rear aspect sliding door leading to the conservatory and has views into the garden, parquet flooring, serving hatch from the kitchen, power sockets and light.The conservatory is of UPVC construction and overlooks the once glorious garden, however with the property being vacant for a while the garden could use some tender loving care. The conservatory has double doors which open to the garden making an it an excellent reading room or summer dining room.The kitchen much like the rest of the house has been repainted and has been given a new lease of life with numerous base and eye level cupboards, sink, oven and separate grill, gas hob, gas boiler, rear aspect double glazed window and door to the garage.First FloorAs you arrive on the first floor, you have access to the loft via the loft hatch with fitted pull down ladder, two large double bedrooms, one single bedroom, one bathroom and one separate toilet. The master bedroom and third bedroom are both front aspect rooms, the second bedroom is rear aspect, with the toilet and bathroom both being side aspect. The bathroom comprises of the bath, sink and a large airing cupboard.LoftThe loft has been completely boarded out and is only a few key steps away from being habitable but with planning permission this loft could be extended. The loft already has two large velux windows and a wooden pull down loft ladder.GardensThe front garden is low maintenance with mainly laid to lawn and is enclosed by a small and a large tree. The driveway is gated and you also have access to the garage.The rear garden is an excellent size and offers further potential to extend (stpp or usual permitted development rules) and is mainly laid to lawn except a small path leading alongside the garage and workshop.Double GarageThe first part of the garage is affixed to the property while the original garage sits a few feet behind the rear flank of the property and also benefits from having an inspection pit, ideal for car lovers. Behind the garage you will find the workshop which has power and lighting.","post_town":"Uxbridge","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43424345?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"A fantastic opportunity to own a larger than average, recently redecorated, three bedroom semi detached family home.
