Thoughtfully refurbished by the current owner, and with two great double bedrooms, a large living room and separate kitchen, the key elements of an urban home are perfectly in place.Within easy walking distance of Hackney Central and moments from the abundance of independent stores and restaurants on Mare Street, this fantastic flat is ideally located for all the brilliant things going on in this much-loved pocket of the East End.Brickworks SaysUnlike so many new and ubiquitous developments, these ???old school??? blocks are solidly constructed, well insulated and built to last. The flat has great proportions too - the second bedroom is a proper double, for example, and the living room could be an ace entertaining space. And being up high, the light is great too.Carefully refurbished by the designer-owners with both the practicalities of everyday living and beautiful aesthetics in mind, the personal touches, such as the painstakingly stripped wooden door frames, give the place a beautifully defined identity and appeal.The Owner SaysI think the thing we love most about the flat its innate sense of character. Thick brick walls, large windows and big rooms give it its good bones but its the little quirks, like the split chimney and original cast iron pipes, that make it unique.The early light floods the lounge making a perfect spot for Sunday morning coffee while the afternoon sun warms the bedroom. Peabody take great care of the estate and foster a strong sense of community. They even fly a hawk around the estate to keep the pigeons away.Over the five years we???ve been here we???ve seen the area really blossom into somewhere special. We???re spoilt for choice with the lovely caf?????s, restaurants and shops that have sprung up but the area still holds its own unique personality. In summer the Hackney Downs park is a particular favourite. It???s wide and open so it gets the sun late into the evening and is a great place for a picnic to watch the sun set over the trees.It???s the warm and friendly people we meet here that really make the place what it is. The flat has meant a lot to us and we???ll be truly sad to leave but it???s lovely to know it???ll be an important part of someone else's life now.Points To ConsiderPart of the London Borough of Hackney, the property falls within Council Tax Band B (??1,033 for 2016/17).The flat is leasehold with 97 years remaining on the term (at the point of marketing). There are 20 flats in the block in total.Service charge contributions equate to ??51.76 per month. Ground rent is ??10 per annum. The care of the block is overseen by Peabody.About BrickworksBrickworks is an independent company committed to an intelligent and ethical approach to estate agency.
