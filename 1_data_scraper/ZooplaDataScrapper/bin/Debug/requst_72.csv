With a brief and ambition far beyond that which a commercial venture would encompass, you can immediately tell that this house has been restored and restructured for the love of great design and a passion for architecture.Found on a horseshoe shaped street, tucked back from St Pauls Road, which runs from Highbury Corner down to Dalston, the location feels a bit of a hidden secret. Still in the thick of things, only moments from Upper Street and Highbury Fields, it is a fabulous spot from which to explore N1 and the city beyond.Brickworks SaysEvery room within this extraordinary house has something to inspire and delight. Some elements are instant, like the glass extension at the back of the house: A glazed wall which extends the footprint of the ground floor and floods the kitchen and dining areas with natural light.Others are waiting to be discovered. The walk-in wardrobe on the first floor, that leads to the en-suite bathroom, for example, which together form part of the master suite, is just gorgeous. The fact that the route through these rooms wraps back on itself means each new space is a lovely surprise.There are brilliant practical elements too, such as the bank of built-in wardrobes in a warm green, on the top floor, providing plenty of storage. And then more subtle attributes like the decorative cornicing, wood panelling and shutters ??? painstakingly restored, imbuing the space with a rich and textured character.Taken together, these design elements and the immaculate finish that is evident throughout, elevate the house to a level that is rare to find. It is a home we simply adore. And we won???t be alone.The Owners SayWe love the social atmosphere the house gives. In the summer we open up the large back doors to the courtyard which allows the ground floor to become a unified space  perfect for entertaining with family or friends.The flooring in the bathrooms and the combination of fittings used is also unique and took a lot of searching to find. These elements are something we adore and will look to replicate (precisely!) in our new home.Plus, we feel super-lucky that we can lay in bed, look out the window and all we see is greenery without being overlooked. It's a repeated joy each and every day.Points To ConsiderPart of the London Borough of Islington, the property falls within Council Tax Band E (??1,584.18 for 2016/17).The house faces opposite a railway line. While this might initially raise an eyebrow, we urge any doubters to come and view. Simply knowing no new developments will spring up is a bonus, but added to that, with a row of mature trees in front, you just get a lovely sense of space. It's super quiet too.The plot of the building is at an angle, which narrows towards the back of the house. In our opinion, the smart interior design has mitigated any potential drawback. Instead, the unusual shapes and angles genuinely only add to the sense of charm.The fittings have been sourced from all over the world and represent some of the finest appliances and bespoke, hand-crafted materials you can find, including Lacanche, Kohler America & Marrakech Design.About BrickworksBrickworks is an independent company committed to an intelligent and ethical approach to estate agency.

Gorgeous lime-washed floorboards cover the double reception room, and a large eat-in kitchen on the ground floor make this a super-practical home, as well as pretty one.Just a ten-minute walk from the nearest tube and inside the admissions area (last year) for the much-coveted Alexandra Park Secondary School as well as the Ofsted outstanding Bowes Park Primary, this is a perfect Victorian house for anyone looking to plant roots in the heart of Bounds Green.Brickworks SaysWe love the light and spacious loft room with bathroom ensuite and the retained period features such as the wooden floorboards, picture rails and fireplace in the living room. However, the sun trap of a south west facing garden with studio-come-mancave has got to be our highlight of this softly decorated, calming home.With loads of space downstairs and three proper double bedrooms above, there is room for a family to live and grow in this lovely house.The Owners SayHaving spent many happy years raising our young family in our home, we will be sad to leave. The house itself is light and peaceful with a sunny south-facing garden. We enjoy cosy log fires in winter and alfresco meals when the British weather allows!The neighbourhood is really friendly with a strong community, and the location is fantastic for outstanding schools, green spaces and transport links (tube and overground), and Muswell Hill and Crouch End are close by for shopping and eating.We have a couple of great local pubs, and there are exciting things happening on nearby Myddleton Road, with independent shops, delis and cafes springing up almost every few months.Points To ConsiderPart of the London Borough of Enfield, the property falls within Council Tax Band D. (??1,481.25 for 2017/18)School admissions areas change every year, so if this is a pre-requisite, do double check with the respective councils ??? Barnet, Enfield and Harringay as the house is on the cusp when it comes to schools applications. A bonus in our opinion.No parking restrictions on the street make life super easy if you have a car. And because it???s close to the north circular it???s a great spot for getting out of London quickly for a day trip or longer visit. Having said this, the tube is a ten-minute walk from the house, so public transport connections are also excellent.About BrickworksBrickworks is an independent company committed to an intelligent and ethical approach to estate agency.
