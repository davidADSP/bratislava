Animal lovers, commuters, families or even those looking to down size could all benefit from living here!What the Owner says:At night I drift off to the sound of the Owl hooting and wake up to the pleasant noise of the Woodpecker. Never before have I lived in such a beautiful setting, living here and over looking the River Wandle attracts all sorts of wildlife. If you were brought here blindfolded you would never guess that your in the middle of Wallington with Croydon & Sutton town centre's just down the road.Having raised my family here over the last 19 years it is now the time for my life to slow down in a different location. I have loved every minute of living here and even added my dog to the family as it was such a great location for her too.Room sizes:Entrance HallLounge/Diner 21'3 at widest point x 11'4 (6.48m x 3.46m)Kitchen 12'9 at widest point x 8'8 (3.89m x 2.64m)CloakroomFirst floorLandingBedroom 1 11'6 x 11'0 (3.51m x 3.36m)Bedroom 2 14'3 x 8'10 (4.35m x 2.69m)Bedroom 3 8'8 x 6'5 (2.64m x 1.96m)BathroomFront GardenRear GardenGarageThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

If cooking a scrumptious meal and spoiling your friends is up your street, the kitchen is fully equipped to cook up a storm, what???s even better is that you overlook the river from the kitchen and will often get distracted by the picturesque outlook.Upstairs this impressive family home doesn???t disappoint, three fantastic size bedrooms are on offer here. The master bedroom is exceptionally large and really is such a wonderful space to recharge your batteries ready for the next day.With lots of history behind the location this property is special for many reasons. Animal lovers, commuters, families or even those looking to down size could all benefit from living here!What the Owner says:At night I drift off to the sound of the Owl hooting and wake up to the pleasant noise of the Woodpecker. Never before have I lived in such a beautiful setting, living here and over looking the River Wandle attracts all sorts of wildlife. If you were brought here blindfolded you would never guess that your in the middle of Wallington with Croydon & Sutton town centre's just down the road.Having raised my family here over the last 19 years it is now the time for my life to slow down in a different location. I have loved every minute of living here and even added my dog to the family as it was such a great location for her too.Room sizes:Entrance HallLounge/Diner 21'3 at widest point x 11'4 (6.48m x 3.46m)Kitchen 12'9 at widest point x 8'8 (3.89m x 2.64m)CloakroomFirst floorLandingBedroom 1 11'6 x 11'0 (3.51m x 3.36m)Bedroom 2 14'3 x 8'10 (4.35m x 2.69m)Bedroom 3 8'8 x 6'5 (2.64m x 1.96m)BathroomFront GardenRear GardenGarageThe information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of an offer or contract, nor may be it be regarded as representations.

Built on what was once the extensive grounds of 'The Manor House' now the 'North Middlesex Golf Club' which included 29 acres of land between, Friern Barnet Lane and Oakleigh Road North. In 1929 the first roads to be built were Church Crescent and Church Way, creating The Church Farm Estate. The plot remained vacant until 1953, when the land changed hands and this particular 'one off' property was built. In keeping with the period the property retains much of its original features. There is a central hallway, with steps down to a guest toilet. The main reception room is 'L' shaped with a recess dining area, 'open plan' design, with a double aspect sitting room with doors to the paved patio. The kitchen has a separate breakfast area and a door to the side entrance. The first floor has low slung eaves and a semi-galleried landing with doors off to all rooms. There are two double bedrooms with a bathroom between them, both being dual aspect. This is a considerably good sized plot with a rear garden in excess of 100ft and a frontage of approximately 40ft. There are original gardeners' outbuildings that predate the house. They consist of a detached garage with attached garden stores. There is a large detached building with original bi-folding rail doors to a cavernous garage. The driveway runs from the front of the house, right to the back where the garaging is. The front is paved with a carriage driveway.","post_town":"London","details_url":"http://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/43390177?utm_source=v1:8rrLFjHMCgDP-Ueseeoy7jCmLR4w1qnZ&utm_medium=api","short_description":"A very pretty Detached House, quite unique for the immediate location, creating a fabulous investment opportunity.
