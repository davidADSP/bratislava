It???s even ideal for those with friends in Clapton, as the bus is literally on your doorstep (which is handy for the commute into work as well). So either peace and tranquillity inside the house, or the delights of Walthamstow and Leyton when you are out. Either way, this house is perfect for both.Living Here...Walk through the front door of this delightful Victorian house, and the first room you will encounter off the hall is the spacious through lounge, which is flooded with light from the bay window. Further along the hallway you will discover a good size kitchen. The house is given warmth by the beautiful orginal wood flooring which runs throughout the houseIn This Area - By Walthamstow DiaryThe whine and creek of a passing bus, air thick with the sound of church bells, a green flash of colour in the sky as Parakeets fly over head. A tangle of quiet residential streets, allotments and green spaces, all presided over by a 200 year old lighthouse. Doesn't sound like Walthamstow does it? But it is, this is Markhouse Road. Whilst Markhouse its self is a main road, the streets that lead off it are anything but. Properties here are a mix of Warner flats, terraced houses, and even some former farmers cottages. Check out the pump house museum, it's free and has working steam engines. It also hosts occasional pop up restaurants in an old Victoria line tube carriage. Jimmys cafe serves a mean fry up and really good Thai food. St James street and St James park are just around the corner, and the marsh, Central Walthamstow and Walthamstow Village are all within walking distance. As for the lighthouse, It's actually a church topped with a lantern instead of bells. If you ever get chance to climb up the tower, do it. You have to navigate ancient, rickety wooden ladders, but the view from top is fantastic.The information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of any offer or contract, nor may it be relied upon as representations or statements of fact.

Also worth noting are the two big bunkers (old coal bunkers) to the front of the house that are for this flat exclusively ??? one has been used as a home office in the past and both make excellent storage solutions.Central London is easily accessible from here, the city is a 20 minute drive, Denmark Hill station (Zone 2) is a 7 minute walk for regular services to Victoria, London Bridge and Blackfriars (10 - 12 mins journey). Sainsbury's is only 5 minutes away, and a host of caf??s, bars and restaurants are just a short stroll from the front door. Try the newly opened Camberwell Arms, The Vineyard for Greek food or The Crooked Well for a good wine list and excellent food. East Dulwich's Lordship Lane is very close and offers some of the best shops in South London including a super deli, organic butchers, boutiques and gift shops plus plenty more excellent places to eat and drink.

It gets its name, or the stone bit at least, from the Highstone mile marker which stands on Hollybush Hill. Bordering Walthamstow, Wanstead, Epping Forest, Leyton and Stratford, Leytonstone has a lot going on. Check out All You Read Is Love on Leytonstone High Road. This independent caf??, bar and bookshop is great spot to sit and while away the hours, they host loads of special events, and you can buy real books (none of those ebooks here). If you are a fan of Vietnamese food, wander down the High Road to Little Saigon, the salt and pepper squid is all kinds of amazing. The Northcote Arms, which is technically in Leyton, is a great pub with a real community feel. And If you want amazing views of the city, go on a tower tour at St John the Baptist Church. The tours don???t run all year around, so you???d need to keep an eye on their website for dates, but it???s well worth doing. The views are simply spectacular, especially at Sunset with the lights of the city set against the darkening sky.Dimensions:EntranceVia front door leading into:Entrance PorchFurther door leading into:Entrance HallwayStaircase leading to first floor.
