There is access into the garage through a door, just off the hallway, and you'll also discover a ground floor W.C.Upstairs to the first floor are 4 double bedrooms, loft access and a modern family bathroom. 3 out of the 4 bedrooms come with en-suites! The master bedroom and bedroom and bedroom 2 have their own private en-suites, whilst bedroom 3 has a jack and jill en-suite, shared with the main family bathroom. In our opinion, the design of this home has been well thought out, making it ideal for any modern family.Outside - The garden is partly paved, whilst the rest is mainly laid to lawn. This entire area is pristine and very well looked after. In the summer, it certainly feels like a sun trap, making it ideal when lazing away in those long summer nights.Caxton Way, Romford RM1;2017-04-07 15:16:20;https://lid.zoocdn.com/354/255/ebaaa9ab516f8006736c61ea34039d7fdaf77b9e.jpg;2017-04-07 15:20:59;51.583344;51.583344;sale;0.183328;false;0;4;0;0;RM1;Romford;700000;;Detached house;for_sale;Caxton Way43484423;Cousins Estates Agents;020 3478 3184;Residential;Please note: This property does require modernisation and updating throughout but offers excellent potential to rearrange as A four bedroom house.Entrance: Via double glazed door leading to hallway, fitted carpet, radiator, stairs to first floor, door to kitchen, door leading to garden.Lounge: 14??? 1??? x 12??? 6??????
