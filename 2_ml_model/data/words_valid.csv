A huge sash window, opposite the fireplace, is a very welcome feature. We also love the pendant lights and solid wooden floors. The flat???s also really light owing to its south-westerly orientation. Beyond the reception area, folding doors open to the bedroom section.

With over 100,000 people working in Canary Wharf at offices including those of hsbc, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Citigroup, kpmg and Morgan Stanley.Popular with city professionals working in the area, Canary Wharf provides an easy commute and plenty of opportunities for after work activities. The area is also popular with students and families, and provides exciting opportunities for investors and first-time buyers. The area has a mix of rental and owner occupied properties.Fantastic Transport LinksLocated on the West India Docks on the Isle of Dogs, Canary Wharf is very well connected, with the Jubilee Line allowing quick and easy access into central London, while the DLR serves the whole of the Isle of Dogs and area surrounding Canary Wharf, including Stratford and London City airport within 20 minutes.

Because the towers design has been inspired by the work of one Londoner, the great explorer, botanist, and inventor, Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward. A doctor by trade, he changed the world with his botanical glass container, the deceptively simple-looking Wardian case, and while contemporary renderings of that design are a defining feature of Wardian, the influence goes beyond the mere visible. The vision for Wardian is to take inspiration from his curiosity, his spirit of adventure and his sense of precision, and to create the most exciting new development in the English capital.These particulars are not intended to, and do not offer or form part of any contract and whilst these sales particulars are believed to be correct, their accuracy is in no way guaranteed.

Further benefits include oak flooring, double glazing, integrated Siemens kitchen appliances, and built-in surround sound speakers with bluetooth connectivity.

The development is ideally located next to Maze Hill station (Southeastern) giving access to London Cannon Street in 16 mins and Greenwich station in 3 mins for transfers via DLR to Canary Wharf. Greenwich town centre, a world heritage site, is within walking distance with its historical points of interest, royal park, museums, and variety of shops, bars, and restaurants as well as river boat services to Central London. This property will appeal to discerning investors and buyers seeking a quiet city retreat and has the option of being purchased furnished. Please call to book an immediate viewing.What the vendor says: ""i've lived in Seren Park for the past six years and have loved it. I bought the flat off-plan as a first-time buyer having been captivated by the location. The development is aptly named, situated in a naturally landscaped basin with a densely wooded backdrop, it has a serene ambience that is rare in London. The transport links are also fantastic, with the City, Canary Wharf and City Airport all only 20 minutes away by train. But probably the biggest draw is the abundance of green space nearby (including Greenwich Park and Blackheath Common) and the flat's proximity to historic Greenwich. I grew up in the area and have always loved Greenwich Park, which boasts some of London's best views, best dogs, the Royal Observatory and of course the Prime Meridian line (the centre of world time). The Park is only 400 yards away from the flat, and it's a lovely walk through to Greenwich village with its famous market, excellent restaurants, Picturehouse cinema, and boutique shops. I like to stroll back from town through the Royal Naval College and breathe in the history. If you're lucky, you'll even catch the occasional period drama being filmed. In the spring, you're also only minutes away from the start of the London Marathon and in the autumn you're a stone's throw away from Blackheath's fireworks display. It's a great place to live, a place that combines the bustle of city life with the tranquillity of a village. I'll be sorry to leave, but a move overseas means it's time to sell to give someone else the chance to enjoy all it has to offer.""",375000,0

And because it???s close to the north circular it???s a great spot for getting out of London quickly for a day trip or longer visit.

43375462,,,"This gorgeous two bedroom flat, located on the first floor of a purpose-built block, is found between London Fields and Hackney Downs. Thoughtfully refurbished by the current owner, and with two great double bedrooms, a large living room and separate kitchen, the key elements of an urban home are perfectly in place.Within easy walking distance of Hackney Central and moments from the abundance of independent stores and restaurants on Mare Street, this fantastic flat is ideally located for all the brilliant things going on in this much-loved pocket of the East End.Brickworks SaysUnlike so many new and ubiquitous developments, these ???old school??? blocks are solidly constructed, well insulated and built to last. The flat has great proportions too - the second bedroom is a proper double, for example, and the living room could be an ace entertaining space. And being up high, the light is great too.Carefully refurbished by the designer-owners with both the practicalities of everyday living and beautiful aesthetics in mind, the personal touches, such as the painstakingly stripped wooden door frames, give the place a beautifully defined identity and appeal.The Owner SaysI think the thing we love most about the flat its innate sense of character. Thick brick walls, large windows and big rooms give it its good bones but its the little quirks, like the split chimney and original cast iron pipes, that make it unique.The early light floods the lounge making a perfect spot for Sunday morning coffee while the afternoon sun warms the bedroom. Peabody take great care of the estate and foster a strong sense of community. They even fly a hawk around the estate to keep the pigeons away.Over the five years we???ve been here we???ve seen the area really blossom into somewhere special. We???re spoilt for choice with the lovely caf?????s, restaurants and shops that have sprung up but the area still holds its own unique personality. In summer the Hackney Downs park is a particular favourite. It???s wide and open so it gets the sun late into the evening and is a great place for a picnic to watch the sun set over the trees.It???s the warm and friendly people we meet here that really make the place what it is. The flat has meant a lot to us and we???ll be truly sad to leave but it???s lovely to know it???ll be an important part of someone else's life now.Points To ConsiderPart of the London Borough of Hackney, the property falls within Council Tax Band B (??1,033 for 2016/17).The flat is leasehold with 97 years remaining on the term (at the point of marketing). There are 20 flats in the block in total.Service charge contributions equate to ??51.76 per month. Ground rent is ??10 per annum. The care of the block is overseen by Peabody.About BrickworksBrickworks is an independent company committed to an intelligent and ethical approach to estate agency.

We knew it was a great area - quiet and peaceful yet so close by to the local school, excellent transport links and shops.When we stepped inside we were blown away by the potential it offered. Over the years we have completely transformed it with everything having been done. We have extended both outwards and upwards and created a very spacious home in doing so. This was important to us as with four children, it was imperative that we had enough space for everyone. We also installed a new kitchen and replaced all three bathrooms as well as adding the plantation shutters and redecorating throughout.
